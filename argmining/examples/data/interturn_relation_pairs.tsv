CMV: I think the board game "Monopoly" is poorly designed	If Monopoly was redesigned to rely less on chance (perhaps a redesign of the board, more mechanics to tip the scales of chance perhaps with better "Chance" cards, or even removal of the pieces entirely) and to be quicker ( Add penalties for each additional player over 3 so that the success and failures of each decision weigh more heavily, for example) then the game will be much more fun and enjoyable to everyone.	0

Though it does this job well, I believe it is this intent that causes it to be thoroughly not fun.	there is very little skill involved in playing the game	0
While this system would work in a **quick** game between 2 to 3 people, monopoly is usually drawn out and played with 4+ players.	I'd recommend pointing out to people that the point of the game is to make trades.	0

Assuming that you're playing with auctions (and preferably without that Free Parking house rule), the key to the game is negotiation.	there is very little skill involved in playing the game	0
Monopoly is drawn out because people don't play by the rules, or the miss the main point of the game	Though it is theoretically sound it may not hold up	0
Perhaps that is the reason why I have such a strong dislike of the game.	By far the most egregious violation of this nature is ignoring the Auction rule (where if the player who lands on an unbought space chooses not to buy it for face value, it is auctioned off to highest bidder), which makes it take much longer for people to build up property, dragging out the early stages of the game.	1
