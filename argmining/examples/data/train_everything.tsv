I point out that many Christians follow the bible which has numerous examples of sexism, but in application, there are numerous branches of Christianity that are no more sexist than secular groups.	1
my belief is that while religion can inform the views of people, it is far more likely that religion will be used to justify actions that would have been executed any way.	1
I think that most Jewish people don't want to stone adulterers and most Muslims don't want to stone non believers.	1
The Amish and the Vedic religions in general haven't been demonized to the same extent as Muslims have.	1
that doesn't mean I should fear Christians.	1
I am just expressing that I find current islam a religion I mistrust.	1
I am not saying everyone should mistrust them or that I should change my behaviour in any way	1
This has nothing to do with the religion but by what we are surrounded by.	1
I'm not going to take an emotional appeal when considering whether or not a religion has dangerous components.	1
What particular aspects do you find toxic?	1
this doesn't say anything about christianity	1
I am just looking at the outcome of people following the religion.	1

the gun certainty played a big part.	2
However, assuming that a gun provides the motivation, it also provides the tool to kill someone with.	2
Without that, they wouldn't be able to kill.	2
So while the person is ultimately responsible, like the gun, religion played a part.	2

but even if religion did motivate people to kill, it doesn't provide the means to kill, only the motivation.	1
I'm not convinced that either motivates people to kill, and one gives the tools to kill with and the other doesn't	1
This analogy falls short for me.	1
Religion gives them the psychological tools to justify to themselves that killing is ok.	1

There would be even stronger calls for an anti-islam and anti-immigration policies.	2
These event reminds people that they cannot depend on protection by government.	2
Say if 1 out of 5 people carried a gun with them, was well trained in its use and tested in his responsibility to prevent its misuse	2
society upheld the value of these people as protectors, it would benefit the society more the the current state of legislature and culture of gun ownership in most of European countries	2
as policemen are a very homogeneous group trained to stick together and the danger of even deepening the "not one of us" (pack) mentality and escalation of "police state"	2
Let's say you're a drug addict and due to your addiction you can't hold down a job, are really strung out and resort to one of the stupidest ways to make $100 for your next fix which is mugging people on the street.	2
because you're desperate	2
If one in 10,000 people are carrying firearms, do you take your chances and try to get someone to hand over their cash without shooting someone or do you kill them outright and steal their valuables off their corpse?	2
How does that decision change when the odds are 1 in 5?	2
Remember, you're an addict and not getting the money is not an option.	2
You pull over and the guy is really mad and he gets out of his car yelling up a storm.	2
You know there is a 1 in 5 chance that the guy is carrying as well.	2
When he's angry and yelling at you?	2
When he reaches into his jacket where his holster might be?	2
After you see the gun?	2
After he points it at you?	2
After he starts shooting?	2
You lose your temper and get out of your brand new car yelling up a storm.	2
You notice after a bit of yelling that the guy is carrying	2
he has observed that you are as well and is scared	2
Do you wait until you're sure he has decided to use his firearm to act?	2
do you act first because by the time you're sure he is going to draw his firearm, you won't have time to act before he shoots you?	2
As soon as it becomes a reasonable assumption, immediately escalating a conflict to deadly force starts being the best option.	2
I've worked in customer service and have been yelled at by strangers more often than anyone should have.	2
If I lived in a society where most people were carrying firearms, I would have had to ask myself "Is this person angry enough to kill me? because if I wait to find out for sure I'll already be dead" way more often than I'd like.	2
you kill for money if you can get away with it	2
The known rule would be only to draw gun to shoot and who is aiming at you is aiming at you to shoot	2
he doesn't you to shoot him either	2
This isn't the movies where you duck bullets and dive behind a table or something.	2
By the time they have their hand on their gun you have maybe 2 seconds	2
by the time they start aiming it at you, you have a fraction of one.	2
There is a reason why police, when they have reason to believe that someone is armed have their guns already drawn.	2
That shit happens fast, and reactive speed isn't fast enough.	2
I don't see them as very likely as nobody is going to draw a concealed gun when not intending to kill.	2
their chances of getting shot would also increase	2
It would still be illegal to kill a robber	2
thus being legal to kill in defense	2
you can't wait for them to draw theirs before you decide to defend yourself if you want to leave alive	2
All you know in all three scenarios is that someone you are in conflict with probably has a gun and there is a significant chance they will use it.	2
because he likely can't kill you within in a few seconds	2
If 1 in 5 people can kill you in seconds being impolite gets deadly very quickly.	2
people with concealed guns don't shoot even if they see someone has a gun too	2
CMV: I think the Paris shooting makes a good case for culture of responsible gun ownership any carrying.	1
I think France is in a tough spot in how to react to this.	1
I think it would be a shame to allow the many, who are afraid more then anything, to be swayed by xenophobic nationalists (which might have been the goal of the attack anyway).	1
I think this, regardless of whether the weapons used by the attackers were owned legally, makes a good case for promoting a culture of a reasonable gun ownership and carrying.	1
I also think this would be much better then increase in police numbers and rights	1
Not getting the money is not an option	1
You're carrying and you rear end a guy.	1
When do you reach for your holster to draw your weapon and when do you fire it?	1
You're carrying	1
you just picked up your brand new car from the dealer	1
while you were at the stoplight some asshole that was obviously texting while driving rear ends you in your brand new car	1
The only reason this stuff doesn't happen all the time is because we can make the reasonable assumption that a person we are having a conflict with is unarmed.	1
I don't think this decision changes if you are comfortable killing for money	1
When he starts to pulling out a gun you try to get cover	1
when he starts aiming at you you draw to fire	1
you are in right to defend yourself	1
If you are unsure of someone's intentions you should get cover	1
as soon he notices that and doesn't intend to kill you he should make this well known to you	1
You'd likely be dead in scenarios 2 and 3.	1
once you remove the non-lethal option, the lethal one gets a lot more comfortable	1
Yes	1
I don't see how you intend to CMV with the scenarios 2 and 3	1
I would expect the effect would be that the still thinking criminals would change to some other safer crime	1
I don't think some of them would start killing	1
Of course you intend to kill the person if you draw your weapon, if you can reasonably assume that they have a weapon,	1
If you don't have reasonable cause to believe someone is armed because very few people have CCWs then things like letting the guy you just rear ended blow off steam becomes a reasonable option	1
I don't think so	1

It sadly didn't do them much good.	2
Unless you bring the same kind of weapons and protections as them it's akin to bringing a knife to a gun fight.	2

Well we have many examples in history when it was common to walk around well armed, where those doing it were upheld as protectors.	2
in many countries you cannot choose to arm yourself appropriately to defend yourself and others.	2

When I see how most people are driving I have absolutely no reason to believe people would be any more capable, responsible or safer with a gun so I would have to worry about all those morons that can't be trusted with anything and about all the rest that maybe just had one of those days and simply forgot to do what they did 10 000 times before.	0
At the same time rather than being afraid of getting mugged I will be afraid of getting mugged by someone pointing a gun right at my face, someone I have no reason to trust won't shot me by accident.	0

*for title clarification, I am NOT referring to either of the paragon or renegade affiliations as the main topic for this post*	0
The Mass Effect games, however flawed though they may be, are some of my favorite games of all time.	0
Now that my bias is clear, I want to say that the completely irrational anger that you may see in the post below IS the reason I'd like my view changed.	0
I apologize for offending anyone and for sounding like an ass.	0
Needless to say, this post is really only meant for those who've played the series, but if you're not afraid of spoilers then feel free to chime in.	0
So here's the brunt of my CMV: If you let any one of your squadmates die, (unless their deaths are unavoidable) you are:	0
a.) incompetent	0
Talk to squadmates semi-regularly, do the loyalty missions, buy the ship upgrades, and -for Gaben's sake- put some points into persuade (you Neanderthal!), and don't make stupid (YES STUPID) choices during the final ME2 mission.	0
It's really not that difficult with a little common sense!	0
RNG killed Mordin during the suicide mission?	0
RELOAD A DAMN SAVE.	0
It's worth it dammit!	0
b.) rushing/missing the damn point of the game	0
Don't give me that "I don't have time" crap; you bought an RPG!	0
You're already taking a good bit time to play the game, so why not take a little more and immerse yourself in the sexy sci-fi universe you paid good money for?	0
You get so much more out of the experience if you just take the time to explore.	0
c.) unfit to fairly criticize the series	0
Firstly, I want to say that I do agree with most of the criticisms of the plot and that it could have been much better than what it was (see the original Kapysharn plot outline for details).	0
However despite its shortcomings, I believe that the real heart of the Mass Effect franchise lies not with the story or the narrative, but with its characters.	0
With only a couple exceptions, the vast majority of Shepard's crew are interesting, fleshed-out characters, each with their own flaws and redeeming qualities.	0
For example, (SPOILERS ME3) seeing Wrex grow from a mere gun-for-hire in ME1 to the responsible, yet still badass leader of the Genophage-free Krogan in ME3 was one of the most gratifying experiences of my gaming career.	0
Similarly, the leap of faith Shepard takes when trusting Legion on Rannoch, thus ending hundreds of years of conflict and bringing the Quarians and Geth together was immensely satisfying and could easily qualify for /r/frission material.	0
Without these experiences, yeah, Mass Effect 3 didn't live up to the hype.	0
How could it?	0
It's such a hollow victory watching Wreav royally screw things up, or watching Tali commit suicide.	0
In my opinion, it's a complete waste of the player's time going about it that way.	0
Regardless of paragon or renegade alignment, I believe there is one right way to play Mass Effect: a completionist run where NO ONE dies.	0
I need help guys.	0
It's getting to the point where I can't even discuss Mass Effect with others without judging someone for letting my favorite characters bite the bullet.	0
Hell, I've put one of my friends off playing the games because I was backseat-gaming during his playthrough.	0
I WANT to believe that games should be played however the player wants to play them, but for whatever reason it's different for me when it comes to Mass Effect in particular.	0
Please, CMV!	0
EDIT: Just wanted to say that I don't take issue with making an intentionally flawed Shepard to see what it looks like. It's just I feel that some who were more critical of the game could've missed out on an important and fulfilling character later on because I a mistake, and that could have potentially negatively color their views and the public perception of the game as a whole.	0
Bah, apologies! I'm rambling, it's late, but I look forward to catching up with your comments tomorrow first thing! Thanks guys!	0

I'll preface this by saying I'm a fan of both the books and movies.	2
When watching the theatrical cuts, I get swept into the story.	2
When watching the extended cuts, I get distracted, and reminded that I'm watching a movie.	2
They break the fourth wall, if you will.	2
Peter Jackson agrees with me:	2
The main objection to this, of course, will be that the extended cuts are able to include more scenes from the books, and are therefore better.	2
They stretched some scenes from brief chapters into center pieces (Helms's Deep) and cut out some of the more... esoteric portions completely (Tom Bombadil).	2
I prefer the pacing in the shorter cut and the director agrees with me is hardly something that can be rigorously argued against.	2
I enjoyed the theatrical cut when I first watched it but the extended was probably better when I had a lot of free time and wanted to watch a favourite movie in a different way.	2

CMV: The theatrical cuts of Lord of the Rings are superior to the extended cuts and should be considered the definitive versions.	1
I like them both for different reasons	1
gun to my head I probably slightly prefer the films.	1
IMO, the extended cuts seriously throw off the pacing of the films.	1
Personally, I think it's a huge mistake to judge the quality of an adaptation by how closely it mirrors the source material, rather than by the strength of it's story telling.	1
The LOTR movies are some of the best adaptations of all time *precisely because* they left a whole lot of the books un-filmed, and a whole lot more on the cutting room floor.	1
Basically, I'm glad Jackson opted to make excellent **movies,** instead of attempting a shot for shot visualization of a **book,**	1
I think the extended cuts subvert his success in that regard.	1
Books and movies are not the same	1
This is much more important than it's faithfulness to the source material.	1
I believe this is true for all adaptations, not just LOTR.	1
How could such a subjective view as the superiority of a cut of three films be argued against?	1
I would argue that the better one depends on context.	1
I'm sure we can find a way to argue about movies ;)	1

There seems to be a commonly held belief that people who cheat on their SO/partner should be dropped immediately with no further contact.	2
in some cases, there are many worse things that can happen in a relationship, which couples seem to be able to work through.	2
**Sex is the most important part of a relationship,** and therefore, betraying it and that agreement mean the relationship should end.	2
**Nobody makes mistakes ever,** so when they do, the relationship should end.	2
**Cheaters will always cheat again,** so better to end it now.	2
other than anecdotal evidence, I haven't seen anything to support this claim.	2
**Cheaters cheat because of underlying issues with the relationship.**	2
such as ... talking about the problem.	2
Maybe fixing that issue will resolve the motivation to cheat.	2
Cheating isn't just a single mistake though.	2
It is a series of mistakes	2
But to reach cheating, you have to not just flirt back, but also start touching, start kissing, start hugging, get to a private location, start undressing, and *then* start having sex.	2
That's no less than seven decisions one would have had to make before that person reaches sexual adultery.	2
If a partner failed to start the dishwasher before going to bed 8 times, that doesn't mean automatic breakup.	2
CMV: People who cheat on their spouses can and should, in some cases, be forgiven	1
I understand that physical/sexual conduct with another person can seem like a betrayal	1
There are a few assumptions underlying the belief that "sex with another person = relationship over" that I don't think hold up.	1
My belief: sex is a very important part of a relationship, but not *the* most important part.	1
My belief: obviously this isn't true, and a cornerstone of strong relationships is the ability to work through mistakes/issues together.	1
my view: That may be true in some cases	1
My belief: if that's true, there are a lot of possibilities - not just breaking up - that could fix the problem	1
Caveat: sometimes, cheating happens because there are parts of the relationship that are fundamentally broken and/or the relationship is too far gone/unsalvageable and/or this is the straw the broke the camel's back etc.	1
Cheating shouldn't always signify an immediate end to a relationship.	1
In some cases, couples can and should choose to work through it	1
each time the cheater made the "mistake," he or she was making *a conscious knowing decision to betray his or her spouse* several times in a row by the time physical cheating happens.	1
A "mistake" would be flirting back with the man or woman who flirts with you at a party while your spouse is away.	1
Yeah, these mistakes are more severe than a dishwasher starting	1
the number of them isn't the question - the severity is.	1

The DSM-IV defines delusion as:	2
A false belief based on incorrect inference about external reality that is firmly sustained despite what almost everyone else believes and despite what constitutes incontrovertible and obvious proof or evidence to the contrary.	2
If someone walks around genuinely convinced they are Jesus, the person is delusional	2
others would want to see that person medicated or receiving some form of psychiatric treatment for that persons own benefit.	2
But out of fear of offending and looking like an insensitive bigot, no one would respond to an otherkin in the same way they would someone claiming ultimate divinity.	2
What about people who think an invisible man in the sky inpregnated a virgin 2,000 years ago with himself and can see and hear every person on earth, including their thoughts and judges whether or not you will burn for eternity even though he knows what you are going to do before you do?	2

CMV: Swimming is the best form of exercise	1
obviously a balanced exercise regimen is the best choice for health and well-being	1
there is no reason other than lack of availability to choose anything other than swimming	1
"best form of exercise" is actually meaningless	1
you are dismissing "lack of availability" as a reason pretty easily.	1
That is probably one of the biggest reasons.	1
fair enough	1
I still feel that for those who are able swimming is the best form of exercise	1

While obviously a balanced exercise regimen is the best choice for health and well-being, if someone were forced to stick to a single exercise technique, there is no reason other than lack of availability to choose anything other than swimming.	0
Swimming is:	0
A) cardio, able to be done at a variety of speeds over a variety of distances, making it suitable for a wide range of fitness levels	0
B) resistance in many muscle groups, especially when strokes in question are varied and tools such as fins or kickboards are added	0
C) low-impact, making it suitable for older people, people with recent injuries, or those with longer-term joint problems	0
D) whole-body (or at least most-of-the-body)	0
With all that said and considered, is there any reason to choose another **single** form of exercise over swimming, other than lack of accessible facilities (EDIT: or physical inability to swim)?	0
Edit 2: view changed, because "best form of exercise" is actually meaningless.	0

As I understand it, and crudely explained, SVT says that in an economic system that lets people hire other people for labour	2
Consider a society of 101 people: 100 workers and 1 boss.	2
The boss owns the factory where the workers work	2
they produce, say, MLP dolls that everyone wants to buy	2
The boss pays each of her workers £5 for each doll that the worker produces, and a worker produces 1 doll a day	2
At the end of the day, the boss has 100 dolls, worth £1000 and has paid out £500	2
Wanting to make a profit on the dolls, the boss then sells the dolls for £10 each.	2
She is now trying to sell £1000 worth of dolls	2
the only people available to sell to are the workers, who's total funds are £500	2
No matter how they rearrange the money between them, they will be unable to buy more than £500 worth of the dolls	2
the rest are waste inherent to the system and a direct result of the boss wanting to make profit.	2
This example then scales up to the whole world when you throw in multiple bosses and lots more workers but the basic idea is the same	2
each worker is being paid less than the price of the things they produce so that their boss can profit	2
Theorems are explanations *of* facts	2
Darwinian Theory doesn't prove evolution to be true - the facts in the real world (such as examples of fossils and stratigraphy and DNA etc) prove the Theory to be true.	2
East and West Germany, North and South Korea, Iron Rice Bowl China versus Free Market China.	2
I can't get wikibot to do it's stuff, but here: http://www.thefreedictionary.com/theorem	2
CMV: Surplus Value Theorem is definitive proof that capitalism is an inefficient system.	1
waste has to be produced in order for the system to function	1
items that cannot be sold must still be produced and thrown away.	1
*No* theorem is "proof"!	1
it's *facts* that prove or disprove theorems.	1
Ultimately the proof/disproof of the efficiency/inefficiency of Capitalism/Communism must come from the comparison and evaluation of historical before and after facts	1

Why can't I be friends with girls (even pretty ones) and not feel insecure when I don't try to advance some romantic agenda?	2
Why do I find myself inevitably becoming attracted to them?	2
because I want to know what older, more mature people think	2
the man tries to show the woman how non-threatening and valuable he is from a non-romantic standpoint before she is comfortable with allowing herself to think of him as a safe partner	2

my perception might just be distorted after reading Neil Strauss's *The Game*	1

Quit putting the pussy on a pedestal.	1
you are doing 2 things	1
dehumanizing females a placing them in a category separate from yourself- almost like a separate class or subspecies...	1
elevating a woman's  sexuality to a higher plane than where it deserves to be.	1
don't put the pussy up there	1
It just makes a guy look a little desperate when he treats a woman and her vagina like a magical unicorn.	1
You may think you aren't guilty of this	1
You are making the pussy very valuable.	1
Making friends with a lot of women actually devalues the shit out of it even if you aren't hitting it.	1
Which long term is a really great thing.	1
Continuing to think of women as magical pussy creatures who aren't worth befriending or even talking to unless you can eventually stick your cock into them is not a good way to form a healthy relationship if you manage to form one at all with those beliefs.	1
I don't want to have relations with any of my male friends and afaik they don't expect any sex from me.	1
That is a really good point.	1
I've been indoctrinated into thinking the way you described: that being friends with girls is something wholly separate from being friends with guys when it's not.	1

the military putting me through Med school will help me jump start life,	1
I'm very inexperienced and haven't seen much of the world and this I think will help me	1
Different branches have different options and very different lifestyles and culture	1
The best branch for that would be the Navy.	1
The Marines aren't knows for their... Genius...	1
The air force isn't right for me	1
I think you need to get a bit better informed if you're going with those particular stereotypes	1
As for getting seasick, it's not as much of an issue on such large ships.	1
there is actually a decent chance to never set foot on a ship.	1
a lot of people looking to join tend to forget that bit	1
it's really the most important part	1
movies which are either terrible representations or great representations of *very specific parts* of the military	1
Out of all the branches, it has the most in common with the civilian world in regards to its culture.	1
I think I still have a lot to research	1
my main reason against the marines was that they are very homogeneous.	1
it's a little creep tbh	1
The Army is a military service	1
the Air Force is a business	1

So here's where I am now: currently in first year of college studying biology, enough AP credits to be a tiny bit ahead of my classmates, an itching to explore this giant world God gave me, I'm also poor and medical school in the military (from what I understand) pays for smart kids.	0
Also, please forgive me if this is wrong or arrogant or whatever, I want the respect that people give men and women in the military.	0
My plan was to graduate College and join the USHS (the military medical school) and become and Army doctor.	0
The only reservation that I had was that it would be a waste of my time because I want to be a neurosurgeon and that's a looooooooong and rigorous path and that I might be losing precious time by joining the military.	0
My mom doesn't want me to join for that reason.	0

Thanks!	0
I want to go a slightly different route here and ask why you would join the Army specifically?	0
Different branches have different options and very different lifestyles and culture.	0
For example, you mentioned that you wanted to see more of the world.	0
The best branch for that would be the Navy.	0
I get seasick lol.	0

Army it is then.	0
I think you need to get a bit better informed if you're going with those particular stereotypes.	0
Did you know the Army's minimum ASVAB score is lower than the Marines, for instance?	0
As for getting seasick, it's not as much of an issue on such large ships.	0
Don't go for the Coast Guard though, that's for sure.	0
And there is actually a decent chance to never set foot on a ship.	0
Especially since the Marines don't have their own medical services.	0
The Navy provides them.	0
In the end, I'd probably recommend the Airforce for you.	0
When you join the military, you sign a contract that gives you a specific(or not so specific if you join the Marines) job.	0
If there is a slot open for a doctor in the Airforce, they'll put in in your contract.	0
If there isn't, you can either wait or go to another branch.	0
Can I ask how much you actually know about actually *being in the military?*	0
I don't want to offend you, but a lot of people looking to join tend to forget that bit, when it's really the most important part.	0
All when the clostest they've been to military life are movies which are either terrible representations or great representations of *very specific parts* of the military.	0
You won't be a *doctor in the military*, you will be a *military doctor.*	0
That's why I recommend the Air Force.	0
Out of all the branches, it has the most in common with the civilian world in regards to its culture.	0
It's only 60 something years old, after all.	0
Okay, thanks so much for the info!	0

One reason I take this stance is because the newly released games are ectremely similar to their predecessors.	2
There are few if any changes in gameplay, and the basic level design for the most part, remains the same.	2
Even Advanced Warfare, which seemed to promise the most novel changes, was criticized for changing too little from its preceding games.	2
Another reason for my opinion is that CoD doesn't really have anything astoundingly different from other games of the same genre.	2
There are a few unique features here and there, but overall, it's just another FPS with nothing spectacular that sets it above the other games in its genre.	2

I don't care if people post nudes, I'm just saying that this is how I feel when I see people posting nudes.	2
simply need because that's their personality and that they feed off of attention.	2
I don't understand how posting images of yourself naked, often with the understanding that others will masturbate to you (/r/gonewild for example) is not empowering but instead a form of whoring yourself out in a sense.	2
CMV: Posting nude pictures online is caused by a need for attention and not empowering	1
I am not saying that people are not allowed to do what they like.	1
Also, I don't mean to suggest that there is anything wrong with posting nudes.	1
Lastly, I have nothing wrong with nudity and am in fact a fan of nudity, I just don't understand exposing yourself to the entirety of the internet on a whim.	1
Whenever I see anyone, male or female, posting nude pictures on the internet, I immediately assume that they are somehow seeking attention.	1
Of course, that's the point, but I think that it must stem from some underlying need to get attention that they must either be lacking in some other part of their life	1
it just means (to me) that that person is seeking attention that they areas not receiving in their interpersonal relationships that they already have and instead seeking that attention through a morally questionable practice with strangers	1
To me anyway, this seems like that person has an underlying weakness.	1
I suppose some people might be satisfied with constructing fantasy scenarios with their partner.	1
To me, that would seem more of a preference than a strength or weakness.	1

So reddit, why do people post nudes? I seriously can't grasp the concept in a way that justifies this action, and have come into conflict with female friends and my gf and would like to be able to see this from another angle.	0
Thanks in advance.	0
EDIT:  Thank you for all of the replies!  You guys pointed out some clearly fallacious opinions I had and also showed me a multitude of other views on the issue.  This is a very personal issue that only pertains to my own beliefs and not something I go around spouting to others.  This was a good learning experience for myself, so again thank you all.  I have deltas to those I felt really stuck with the discussion, but I'd like to thank you all for commenting.	0
I guess my question for you would be: what is inherently wrong with seeking attention?	0
If you're doing so in a way that takes away from others, I can see the problem: e.g., if you're one of those people who feels the need to one-up *every* story at a party, you might need to learn to chill out and share the spotlight.	0
But if your contributions are welcome and socially appropriate (e.g., you're not spamming the subreddit with new posts), then why does the "attention seeking" (if that's what it is) strike you as being a problem?	0
Like I said, I have no problem with it, it just means (to me) that that person is seeking attention that they areas not receiving in their interpersonal relationships that they already have and instead seeking that attention through a morally questionable practice with strangers.	0
To me anyway, this seems like that person has an underlying weakness.	0
> it just means (to me) that that person is seeking attention that they areas not receiving in their interpersonal relationships that they already have	0
Can you really take care of exhibitionist desires just in your personal relationships?	0
I suppose some people might be satisfied with constructing fantasy scenarios with their partner.	0
But it is weakness to post pictures, or weakness to decide that you are too ashamed or worried about consequences to post pictures, even though you want to?	0
Are you saying that it is weakness to want to post pictures in the first place?	0
(To me, that would seem more of a preference than a strength or weakness.)	0
A "standard" hiring method would ensure that every applicant would be evaluated on the same criteria - the satisfaction of requirements of the position  merits relevant to that position.	2
Who an applicant knows is occasionally useful for those jobs which require maintaining relationships with certain people in key positions (e.g. sales), but for the vast majority of jobs, who your friends are is functionally irrelevant.	2
Allowing someone to circumvent the standard application process ("jumping the line") or to use some important person's recommendation as additional clout for their application ("came very highly recommended by Bob") is preferential treatment for irrelevant qualities.	2
This is a failing of the existing job application paradigm, not an excuse to circumvent it in order to make the process easier.	2
Beyond straight nepotism, it is self-evident that individuals who come from families  backgrounds which allow for more interaction with individuals in power will be able to call on more of those individuals for networking purposes.	2
Individuals who are extraordinarily qualified for a position but come from a region/social background without those connections enter a networking-friendly employment opportunity at a disadvantage.	2
Allowing networking to influence a hiring decision is not dependent on cultural bias  may be safely exorcised from the hiring process to render it more fair	2
This decreases social/economic mobility, which has been demonstrated to be bad for societies in general.	2
If the egalitarian hiring process in-place is so ineffective at determining qualifications/character that it must depend on recommendations from trusted sources to establish merit, the productivity of any positions where such a trusted source does not come forward will suffer.	2

Networking is discriminatory.	1
I recognize  appreciate that it is difficult in most employment processes to find individuals who are trustworthy, socially apt, etc.	1
Networking, as a practice, favors individuals who come from already socially favorable situations, moreso than other evaluation criteria.	1
there are other unfair advantages an applicant might have (being tall, white, male, etc.).	1
Businesses  societies would be better off disallowing networking from influencing their hiring decisions.	1
If a hiring process takes networking into account, it is necessarily showing preference to individuals who already come from advantaged background, as per 2.	1

I mean lots of people know of jobs because of contact from friends.	0
Your view sounds great, but do you have any idea how you would implement it?	0
The same way ethical business and hiring practices are enforced - make a rule, punish those who violate it.	0
If a company wants to hire based solely on merit, have some oversight to make sure networking is not affecting that process.	0
If a society does, make laws regarding such.	0
Punish people for simply talking about their work?	0
Because I would imagine if one friend tells another friend that there is a job opening that would be against the law per your view.	0

It's too dark	2
almost violent	2

the Toaster killing himself for the master	2
Concepts like death or dying in children's features are incredibly out of favor right now.	2
those franchises have been out for over 15 years, and so they get a pass from the now adults who enjoyed the movies as kids.	2
If we`re using a level of "dark" of the level of Brave Little Toaster then why did things like The Iron Giant and Land Before Time get a ton of love associated with them.	2
one contains a death of someones mom	2
the other almost had an entire town nuked as well as a giant death machine moving through	2
CMV: I believe the Brave Little Toaster is an incredibly underrated movie	1
Ive seen a lot of animated movies in my life but in my opinion they dont stand up to the Brave Little Toaster.	1
I feel like this masterpiece is largely unappreciated by a majority of people in favor of other animated movies.	1
Reddit I think the Brave Little Toaster needs some more attention and some more love.	1
The fact that it's underrated largely stems from the fact that by today's measure it's far from a children's movie, which unfortunately in western countries is generally the target demographic for animated features.	1
I grew up watching the movie, and it doesn't bug me	1
when the alternative is Adventure Time or My Little Pony, I'm likely to think that Brave Little Toaster isn't good viewing material for kids in 2014	1
You can make arguments for something like Toy Story	1
There have been a great many "dark" animated movies and shows that grew to become extremely famous.	1
Land before Time has about 15 other movies in the franchise which make it popular, much like toy story	1
Iron Giant doesn't really deal with much that's terribly dark or controversial	1
I personally believe Iron Giant to be the darker film because of the war undertone	1

I would be inclined to say that terminally ill people shouldn't be elected either, because they wouldn't have to deal with the consequences either.	0
In my view, I'd say that homeless people would be ideal for leaders, since they know exactly what the problems are, although they don't contribute financially.	0
Still, this (especially the trust fund part) is making me realize it isn't a perfect idea, although I still believe it is a good idea.	0
> Also, if old people can't vote than who will represent their interests?	0
I really don't think that the over 62 demographic has any concerns that effect (affect?) just them.	0
> Well how can you expect young people who haven't experienced being old to make informed voting decisions regarding retirement?	0
As you mentioned, it will directly impact them in the future.	0
> do you really expect people to prioritizes decades in the future over the short term?	0
I realize that they won't always prioritize long-term interests, but at least they have a reason to, unlike old people.	0
Hope I covered everything.	0
> In my view, I'd say that homeless people would be ideal for leaders, since they know exactly what the problems are, although they don't contribute financially.	0
I get where you are coming from but I think you are putting too much stock in the idea that you can only empathize and understand a situation if you have lived through it.	0
I grant you that there is merit to that idea but, lets be frank, if someone is doesn't have their life together to the point where they are out on the streets, how can we expect them to lead anything?	0
This is why politicians have advisors on staff, so that they can get "expert" opinions when they are under educated on an issue.	0
America (and every other country in the world for that matter) has a vast array of problems ranging from social to economic to geopolitical, for this reason its better to have someone who is an effective problem solver.	0
While a homeless person might have some very valuable insight on dealing with life on the streets, that doesn't mean they would have strong ideas on how to actually go about solving that problem, not to mention on how to deal with America's complicated relationship with China (for example).	0
This is why you see so many older people in politics, it takes time to build the experience (and contacts/wealth/name recognition) to be able to handle the massive amount of varying problems politicians face.	0
As the story goes, when Jesus was about to be born his parents were travelling to Bethlehem, but when they got there the inn was full, so Mary had to give birth in the barn	2
The problem is, if nativity scenes are any indication, baby Jesus was still in the manger when the three wise men came to visit and give him Christmas presents	2
Most people know Jesus was born on Christmas, but less realize that the wise men didn't show up until the Epiphany twelve days later	2
Because that would be the most unbelievable aspect of the entire story if you ask me	2
it seriously strains credulity to begin with	2
Even miracles make more sense in the context of the birth of the Son of God	2
Maybe a virgin really could give birth to a deity, or a new star could magically appear over the birthplace	2
there's no reason for the inn to miraculously have no rooms come open for nearly two weeks	2
Plus Mary and Joseph would be the first to know when something came available since they were basically squatting in the garage and would surely notice when patrons came to get their ox or camel or whatever before leaving	2
Joseph probably would have made that barn the family's permanent rent-free residence if the wise men hadn't showed up bearing enough cash and prizes to go live it up in Egypt	2
why did they stay so long anyway?	2
It's not like Mary needed the time to recuperate	2
Thanks to baby Jesus' healing powers even her hymen immediately regenerated, kind of like the redhead vampire from True Blood or the cheerleader from Heroes	2
Not the real life Hayden Panettiere though, you know those gigantic Klitschkos split that wide open.	2
the son of god and his holy mother were Jews	2
Because that's a part of the Easter story even though it was technically a Jew being crucified on Good Friday.	2
CMV: Nativity scenes are antisemitic.	1
This has nothing to do with the celebration of Christmas excluding religious minorities	1
traditional nativity scenes reinforce negative stereotypes about Jews	1
Are we honestly expected to believe that no vacancies opened up at the inn for almost two weeks?	1
The obvious implication is that Jesus' chintzy Jewish stepdad was such a tightwad that he was willing to let his pubescent wife and her newborn baby sleep in donkey slop if it would save him a few shekels	1
Aren't Mary and Joseph, two holy people, especially perfect virgin Mary, both Jews? Wasn't Jesus a Jew??	1
Yes	1
Joseph was just a regular Jew without the same kind of holiness as the other two.	1
Okay	1
I wouldn't call a story about them antisemitic even if the villains in the story are also Jewish.	1
Isn't the characterization of Jews as "Christ-killers" rooted in antisemitism?	1

therefore passed down by parents	2
For example, we could use the IQ scale (for want of a better intelligence measure) to determine the number of offspring a person should be able to genetically contribute to.	2
Like, round the IQ to the nearest multiple of 50, then divide by 50, and that's the number of offspring you're allowed to create.	2
So someone with near average intelligence (near 100 IQ, 75-124) would have their IQ rounded to 100 and then divided by 50 to make 2 offspring.	2
The total offspring is presumably equal to the number of people who contributed to it.	2
A man and a woman with average IQ can have two children (not each.) and sustain their population.	2
Conversely, really above average IQs of 125-174 can contribute genetically towards 3 children... and so on.	2
therefore more likely to survive and advance the human race.	2
I know this would be a bitch to implement and it's near impossible to actually do	2
I know the IQ test has its faults and every policy can be abused	2
If a mother can make 2, and has twins, she can't make more, but if she already has one and has twins after one which makes 3, we're not gonna kill one	2
Perhaps if you have a major, heritable health issue your IQ has 25 subtracted from it before being rounded?	2
maybe weighted differently, like extremely high chance of cancer (almost 100 percent or something) takes off more... Something like that.	2
Much better than "Kill off those with IQ less than 80"	2
I wouldn't mind a smarter human race...	2
How do you prevent people from having more than the allotted number of children?	2
Forced sterilization?	2
Forced abortions?	2
Prison?	2
Fines?	2
Taking away the children?	2
All of these are terrible options, and there aren't any good ones.	2
CMV: Eugenics isn't all that bad... And we don't even have to kill anyone for it	1

There is an unchecked organization that spies on them 24/7 without consent.	2
The US has given itself license to detain and torture citizens with no trial.	2
The energy laws in that country allow corporations to drill where they please and, as a result, poison who they please.	2

You have yet to give evidence that there is widespread tampering with free and fair elections which define the US as a democratic state.	2

doesn't have a spy network".	2

Like many American kids, I was often forced throughout my childhood to participate in "Monopoly" games with my family.	2
it just seems to be a giant crapshoot the whole way through	2
Once ~50% of the board has been claimed, even if the landholdings of all the players are about equal, it is immediately obvious which player will lose based on who falls in another's territory first and has to pay the incredulous tax.	2
After that, it is just a long fall into bankruptcy as eventually the player has to sell their property to others, decreasing the chance that they can earn revenue while simultaneously increasing the chance that the others can profit from them.	2
One after another, a player pays out the net-worth to the other players until there is a long, long drawn-out stand-off between the remaining few.	2
At this point, it comes to down to complete and utter chance.	2
Whomever gets the worst successive dice rolls loses.	2
When that happens, barring any statistically unlikely dice rolls, it is evident who will lose.	2
But the game keeps going and going, because it would be "unfair" to keep going despite the likely outcome.	2
perhaps a redesign of the board	2
more mechanics to tip the scales of chance perhaps with better "Chance" cards	2
even removal of the pieces entirely	2
Add penalties for each additional player over 3 so that the success and failures of each decision weigh more heavily	2
As of right now, after the first few passes around the board, it is easier to calculate the theoretical outcome with the help of a computer then to finish the game to its completion.	2
Where someone can get obscenely rich with not much anyone can do about it due to the luck of landing on key properties/avoiding others.	2
Perhaps laissez faire capitalism (or of the chain-gang bullshit going on in the gilded age),	2
In fact, Adam Smith (origin of laissez faire) did not like landowners,	2
saying that they did very little to improve the economy/society	2
just sit on their land charging whatever damn price they want.	2

After building in requirements for parents to attend a weekly P/T meeting and/or more,   I think we could minimize the amount of shitty parents getting paid,  and  instead deposit that money into a trust for the student, paid upon graduation.	0
there is no afterlife	2
we die	2
Living life is as irrational as reading a book that, after finished, is immediately erased from your memory	2
It is comparable to that, too	2
Either way, after my brief spark of existence I become nothingness	2
Not only do I remember nothing; I AM nothing	2
To me, it is as if my life had never happened	2
Imagine the time before you were born	2
Of course not	2
You didn't exist	2
This is the state that we return to after death--a state of nothingness similar to the state we were in before birth	2
When I die, I return to this state after a brief period of consciousness	2
I return to it permanently	2
I might as well have never lived	2
They will die too	2
And then their descendants will die, on and on and on	2
eventually the universe is destroyed or our galaxy collapses in an inevitable heat-death	2
Even if 1,000,000 people were helped by me	2
assuming they all die	2
For I will be dead and won't know what I did	2
once they die, they won't know either	2
I'll be dead, and again, death is nothingness	2
Thus, I won't be around to enjoy my fame	2
once I die, all memories and all point is gone	2

life is ultimately meaningless and pointless	1
Death is the great eraser	1
It makes no difference if I, a 23 year old, die now or live until I am 100 and die	1
Helping others doesn't matter	1
then my life is still pointless and meaningless	1
(2) Attaining fame doesn't matter and doesn't truly make me "immortal."	1
Enjoying the moment is possible	1
doesn't make life have a point	1
You make your own purpose in life	1
The only way your life lacks meaning is if you give it none to begin with	1
once you die, it is as if none of it ever happened	1

Consider a novel.	2
As you read through the novel, you go from page to page, eventually reaching the end	2

Time isn't "real" in the same sense that we experience it	2
We are simply at one point along a path, and that's the "now"	2
All the other points in time exist as much as the current point in time, however	2
Let's say I travel from home to the grocery store	2
I leave my apartment, go down the elevator, out on the street, past the cigar shop, past the empty parking lot, and finally to the store	2
Now* I'm at the store, but did my apartment, my elevator, the street I walked on, the cigar shop, and the empty parking lot cease to exist simply because I'm not there *right now*?	2

That is what life is like	1
Life is pointless in a similar manner	1
I wouldn't consider it pointless if I derived pleasure from reading it at the time	1
I would guess that it's because you derive pleasure from certain things in life and that you pursue these things just like everyone else does	1
I might as well go ahead and die	1
Why is it irrational to pursue something pleasurable that will not provide pleasure of an infinite duration?	1
That seems like an arbitrary condition to apply to the value of pursuing pleasurable things.	1

CMV: EMTs, SAR, firefighters, police, etc. should receive military discounts.	0

For those of you who dont know, its common (at least in the US) for businesses, transit agencies, etc. to give small discounts to military veterans to thank them for their service.	0
It seems that medical responders (even hospital staff, actually) and other emergency services do more good for society than soldiers and that such discounts should be given to them.	0
As for the Theyre not risking their lives for our country. argument, police officers do that too, and for citizens rather than the country and its interests.	0
Some might argue that soldiers do the US a disservice rather than help, but thats [usually] the fault of their leaders and therefore not relevant to the debate.	0
Im really hoping theres a good reason behind the status quo, but well see.	0
[It looks like theres even less reason behind it than I initially thought, actually.]	0

/comments/2rexe3/cmv_emts_sar_firefighters_police_etc_should/cnfj9cu?context=10000) In summary, I think that EMS people are just as deserving of these discounts (and that many more people contribute enough to be placed in the same category), but I now believe - for the same reason - that these discounts shouldnt be offered at all.]	0
You haven't really participated in this thread, but I'd like to point out federal vs. municipal difference when it comes to location of the discount.	0
A coffee shop in Seattle might very well decide to have a local firefighters discount, (I can name a few that do.)	0
But should they honor a vacationing firefighter from Omaha?	0
How can he prove he's a firefighter?	0
Why should a Seattlite care that a man's employed by a city in Nebraska?	0
While states may have local branches of National Guard, active duty military members serve the nation as a whole and carry one (1) form of identification that is accepted *everywhere.*	0
This simplifies the discount process and may point to a succinct reason why they tend to receive a blanket discount in most areas of the US.	0
Thats a good point, though Im curious as to why they dont advertise the other discounts.	0
Admittedly, it's not as common as the military discount, but the places that have it advertise the hell out of it.	0

So what do you do when you discover [the suffering animals endure in the vegetarian food industry?]	2
Livestock animals eat a hell of a lot more crops humans do right?	2
if you're really concerned with the damage done by the land use of growing food	2
The land required to feed one vegan for a single year is 1/6th of an acre and the land required to feed one meat eater for a year is 18 times more than that.	2
How much grass do you eat on an average day?	2
More corn is produced for livestock than humans.	2
36% of all privately held acres in the US is used for growing corn just for livestock.	2
That's without even getting into the massive amounts of land used for soy and hay production for livestock.	2
It's written by an Australian (where most livestock is grass-fed)	2
explicitly notes that it only applies when livestock is fed on grass rather than grain	2

There is no "meaningful" or "meaningless" life for an animal - they don't philosophize beyond needs.	2

Does intelligence really make much of a difference when it comes to the ethics of whether we can kill them without moral concern?	2

I had to take my cat to be euthanised at the vet	2
we domesticated those pet animals for the purpose of companionship	2
in the case of the dog, a symbiotic relationship involving feeding them scraps for protection against predators that their scent can pick up easier than our sight, particularly at night	2
bonded with them specifically because their utility functions are greater as companions than as meat	2
Also, again, local farms and humane slaughtering, not factory farming.	2
As far as I'm aware, chickens at my local farm have their brains destroyed at the stem as quickly as possible while their head is chopped off.	2
Gory, but painless, as the pain center is instantly destroyed.	2
it has as little pain as we can deliver.	2
that would taint meat, and so is unfeasible	2
Carrots get eaten or boiled alive and we have no evidence that suggests, one way or another, if that is causing them suffering	2
their nervous system is sufficiently different from us	2
there are plants that emit pheromones to alert other plants of an impending insect-predator's presence and causes other plants in the area of the same type to activate defenses	2
other plants that will actively tense up in response to needle pricks	2
will stop responding when exposed to typical anasthetics	2
chickens, pigs, deer, and cows would have their throats ripped out by weasels or wolves or whatever other predator.	2
they'd die slowly and painfully of some disease that they have no hope of overcoming, or slowly and painfully of starvation after breaking a leg and falling behind their herd	2
Nature is not pretty	2
I work best when I've had more to eat than a salad	2

we have domesticated some animals	2
Are you seriously saying you consider slaughtering an animal morally equal to harvesting a crop?	2

A bolt to the brain sounds bad	2
No pain, no awareness, just cessation of life	2

The options are as follows	1
1. You don't agree with what is going on and stop supporting it.	1
2. You don't care about animals, so you're content with paying for them to be abused for your pleasure.	1
3. You don't agree with what is going on, but try to put it to the back of your mind and continue to support it.	1
I suspect this way of looking at it is still somewhat simplistic however	1
I buy all my meat from local farms that I know have free-range chickens and cows that are grass-fed and well-treated until they are humanely slaughtered	1
I personally don't see any distinction between my pet dog and a chicken.	1
I would never consider his throat being sliced by a machine as he hung upside down as humane treatment.	1
Probably not even a bolt to the brain either.	1
I agree that synthetic meat would be absolutely amazing though!	1
I do see a distinction between a pet and livestock	1
Chickens simply aren't.	1
I wouldn't want to witness it	1
I would accept that as a humane death (as humane as we can make death, anyway)	1
a better way would be a proper Brompton Cocktail	1
here is the big problem I have	1
It is literally impossible for me to live without other things dying.	1
I wish it weren't so	1
it is	1
we wouldn't know what we were looking for	1
when plants behave in an animal-like manner, they can and do respond to some sort of pain stimuli.	1
So, I don't consider plants to be necessarily more moral.	1
I find death by human to be more humane than death by any other cause that most game or livestock animals could hope for	1
At the best	1
At best	1
we should be working to improve it	1
future animals benefit more by my consumption of meat than they would if I was trying to go vegetarian/vegan	1
I may have a different stance on seeing no difference between companion animals and farm animals	1
does not mean they suffer any differently to their wild cousins.	1
I consider my 1 chicken/2 days to be morally equivalent to the 8 heads of lettuce/day it would take me to get the same basic caloric intake (note: I don't have any real accuracy for the amount per day, just a rough guesstimation) to be about morally equal.	1
A sheep with a shepherd is many times less likely to have its throat ripped out by a wolf and having its last experience on earth be something as gruesome as the beginnings of being eaten.	1
there is nothing past that instant	1
at the very least we are less vicious than other predators in that we wait until the animal is definitely dead before we start eating it	1
I'm not arguing that death at the hands of humans is better than living on	1
living on is better than just about any death	1
I'm arguing that of the potential ways to die, being killed is the best an animal can realistically hope for	1

Finally, here is the big problem I have: It is literally impossible for me to live without other things dying.	0
I wish it weren't so, but it is.	0
Carrots get eaten or boiled alive and we have no evidence that suggests, one way or another, if that is causing them suffering, as their nervous system is sufficiently different from us that I believe we wouldn't know what we were looking for.	0
However, there are plants that emit pheromones to alert other plants of an impending insect-predator's presence and causes other plants in the area of the same type to activate defenses, and other plants that will actively tense up in response to needle pricks (which, further, will stop responding when exposed to typical anasthetics), which tells me that when plants behave in an animal-like manner, they can and do respond to some sort of pain stimuli.	0
So, I don't consider plants to be necessarily more moral.	0
Further, I find death by human to be more humane than death by any other cause that most game or livestock animals could hope for.	0
At the best, chickens, pigs, deer, and cows would have their throats ripped out by weasels or wolves or whatever other predator.	0
At best they'd die slowly and painfully of some disease that they have no hope of overcoming, or slowly and painfully of starvation after breaking a leg and falling behind their herd.	0
Nature is not pretty, and we should be working to improve it.	0
I work best when I've had more to eat than a salad, so in the long run, future animals benefit more by my consumption of meat than they would if I was trying to go vegetarian/vegan.	0
I may have a different stance on seeing no difference between companion animals and farm animals because many of my pets are exotic and farm animals.	0
The fact we have domesticated some animals also does not mean they suffer any differently to their wild cousins.	0
Are you seriously saying you consider slaughtering an animal morally equal to harvesting a crop?	0
In a day, I eat maybe 1/3 of a cow or 1/2 of a chicken if I'm hungry	0
If I were eating veggies, I'd consume several plants.	0
I consider my 1 chicken/2 days to be morally equivalent to the 8 heads of lettuce/day it would take me to get the same basic caloric intake (note: I don't have any real accuracy for the amount per day, just a rough guesstimation) to be about morally equal.	0
>The fact we have domesticated some animals also does not mean they suffer any differently to their wild cousins.	0
On the contrary: A sheep with a shepherd is many times less likely to have its throat ripped out by a wolf and having its last experience on earth be something as gruesome as the beginnings of being eaten.	0
A bolt to the brain sounds bad, but there is nothing past that instant.	0
No pain, no awareness, just cessation of life.	0
Ditto that for every other domestic food animal, and even animals that we hunt for food: at the very least we are less vicious than other predators in that we wait until the animal is definitely dead before we start eating it.	0
I'm not arguing that death at the hands of humans is better than living on; in the general sense, living on is better than just about any death; I'm arguing that of the potential ways to die, being killed is the best an animal can realistically hope for.	0

CMV: I believe you have three choices once you discover the suffering animals endure in the meat industry...	1
The options are as follows	1
1. You don't agree with what is going on and stop supporting it.	1
2. You don't care about animals, so you're content with paying for them to be abused for your pleasure.	1
3. You don't agree with what is going on, but try to put it to the back of your mind and continue to support it.	1
I suspect this way of looking at it is still somewhat simplistic however	1
You hate animals and you want to see them killed.	1
View. Changed.	1
Hmm maybe if it makes it easier for you	1
I can imagine someone that has empathy for humans but none for other animals.	1
Good point	1
I regard that as speciesism.	1
I do have a Christian friend who is extremely charitable	1
I rationalise this by realising that helping people is her passion	1
I think it's fairly normal to be a speciesist.	1
I'm not trying to argue from a point of naturalism in regards to what ought to be done	1
it shouldn't be that surprising when we encounter people that are that way	1
it's hard enough for many people to empathize with *each other*	1
It's just beyond the scope for many people	1
the bible states that all animals were put on earth by God to serve man	1
There were rules against eating certain kinds	1
overall the idea was that humans have dominion over all	1
there is no cognitive dissonance	1
this would probably fall under your 2nd line of reasoning	1
Yes, speciesism is indeed the norm	1
I appreciate you taking the time to comment	1
I asked this question so as to keep myself grounded in what other justifications my loved ones around me didn't have the same epiphany I did	1
A very good reminder, thank you	1
Not everyone is as obsessed with philosophy, psychology and nature as I am	1
I'd still class it as option 3 though	1

There have been 55 million abortions in the US since 1973	2
Something in the ballpark of 45% of women who have abortions have more than one abortion	2
Waging war to purposefully lower population, even with a country facing similar issues, would cost not only resources, but it would also cause political, cultural, and global issues	2
America's innovation and education rankings would be lower	2
Every middle-class child in the country would receive a lower quality education if there were 55 million more around	2
Without the extra population from abortions, has there been proportionately more immigration to fill labor needs, or are the millions of illegals from Mexico as likely to be so numerous even if there was a higher none-abortion population	2
Doesn't immigration of a working class citizen on such a massive scale cause dissonance in a country more so than it does cultural exchange	2
Or are we talking about a population so huge that race and national identity are insignificant, that there is always going to be a huge amount of hostility between different demographics	2
surely its a significant number	2
how many of these women wouldn't be having financial troubles if there wasn't competition from cheap illegal labor to keep wages lower	2
An aborted fetus is likely to have been a less productive person than a never-considered-for-abortion fetus	2
A Zeitgeist wherein 55 million abortions is weighed as good for industry or not, the resulting thinking it good on account of efficiency, as certain citizens look on themselves and others as a figure or livestock	2
Once killing foreigners is an acceptable/inevitable means to profit and expand, you find that attitudes exposed to such behavior change with it	2
>Other countries also build militaries to do so and to "defend" against each other	2
everybody's doing it and so must do it	2
You'll be hard-pressed to find moon worshipers today	2
the "religions of the book" may be going out of style as highly literate people have access to more historical data and the time to translate The Bible, Torah, and Quran in context for themselves	2
now it's seen as wrong, even by the religions themselves	2
children are moved through by age, graded literally on the same scale as a meat product, and bells move them around	2
Good meat or bad meat, instead of people with a variety of skill potential and problems	2
We end up with McEducation literally, with a lot of "product" to be "thrown away" and that seen as okay	2
the Zeitgeist within society that people should be "grown", and graded, and that these categories are accurate	2
Consequential attitudes include the idea that information will be bestowed to us like our teachers did	2
it's "true" or not and that "truth" is available to us in an absolute way	2
that smart people are cooperative	2
Political parties appeal to these learned biases	2
it's seen as disruptive, problem-making, and culturally odious, and taking sides on trust is often seen as a good thing	2
Decisions are give-and-take and has benefits as well as problems	2
there would have certainly been benefits to a preemptive tactical nuclear strike against the USSR, and costs too	2
Anybody who denies either is blinded by zeal	2
If you cannot see the cost of the 55 million abortions, it means that you should immediately change your view so you can experience the other side of your thinking	2
which has hijacked your perception and mistaken itself for truth recursively	2
This America faced a sustainable growth rate	2
Imagine this country to be populated by billions of faces	2
Babies were created indiscriminately	2
The quality of education regressed and then stagnated to that of the year 1970	2
Even with new technology, having enough drinking water and arable land is becoming an issue	2
Everything is polluted to hell	2
The wealth gap is a factor of ten worse	2
The perception of the value of human life goes to zero	2
I believe in a shittier today for a better tomorrow, such as how our ancestors had miserable and productive lives that ended up with us living to be 80 and fat	2
I also don't think that the connection between poor education tactics and the "don't think too much" mentalities can be drawn between the zeitgeist claims you're making	2
If the quality of life is higher, you'll see higher quality education and the available resources for more to be able to think and live as as they'd like	2
If the quality of life is lower, you'll see people working miserable jobs just to be able to eat dinner	2
the only way to avoid depression would be to not think too much	2
Having a low quality of life results in a poor Zeitgeist	2
I chose this approach because your view is highly cerebral and overconfident, seemingly unconcerned with potential consequence, and repackaging gross oversimplification and naive callous as bright utilitarianism (no offense)	2
I wanted to offer an example that had to do with people, instead of indulging your quasi-psychotic reasoning	2
I'm telling you this because you're probably a teen and will grow out of it by interacting with people like you are	2
having them challenge you and show disgust	2
Psychotics are developmentally stunted because they're antisocial, even when they're around people	2
they never change their view and only develop a 7-year-old view from a little monster into a big monster	2
the stupid and shallow premises would remain untouched	2
you're concerned you'll miss something, and are aware of the dangers of missing something	2
The mind and emotions operate like extremely complex equipment	2
This is why some people are very squeamish; myself not included	2
Contrarily, when a person is very confident, it's [almost never because they're on a higher tier of information or understanding	2
because they don't even know that they don't know	2
In the case of cold utility, often peddled by teens as very novel because life and the self seems very simple to them, because they've such a low tier of contact with the world that it can look simple from a distance	2
It's why we recruit teens into the military	2
They're very easy to trick and convince to shoot a guy in a field for wearing different clothes without asking a lot of questions or thinking too hard about consequences	2
it was really tailored to challenge your reasoning style	2
You don't know what you don't know, you didn't know you didn't know my motivation, and you don't know that the 55 million abortions were a good thing, or what interests were operating in the establishment of them, or the consequences	2
My inferior mind must be shown new views in order for me to see how wrong my initial view is	2
There is an assumption every other sentence with the remaining sentences being filled with assertions that you have not been backed with well-founded arguments	2
You completely circumvented every single debate being had in this thread and proceeded to ejaculate your rather arrogant assumptions all over the place	2
It seems that you can barely fathom that you *may* be wrong, that you are too intelligent to have to provide any adequate reasoning for yourself	2
On the contrary to the Dunning-Krueger effect you are implying that I face, I am very critical of myself and feel incompetent in areas where others rate me as competent	2
I have not said a single thing in this thread that i've been absolutely sure of	2
It boils down to a well constructed shitpost	2
*those abortions may have been a good thing?	2
you can have that thought	2
* **you are a retard!** *argue about whether or not these abortions have had a benefit to the country?	2
how you spent the past two comments trying to classify me, inform me of my inadequacies, *subtly be a superior human being*, and also fall under what seems to be the Dunning-Krueger effect yourself	2
Can I comment on your inferior reasoning and why it's inferior without it being a big deal	2
Did you expect people to *not* shoot holes in your reasoning	2
that I said that	2
you know that :)	2
you probably should have anticipated people finding your worldview to be wrong on CMV	2
Didn't you anticipate your apparent reasoning to be challenged in the least	2
Or did I do it too offensively well	2
There's [plenty of research](http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog-extra/the-adolescent-brain-beyond-raging-hormones) supporting that their minds aren't fully developed	2
that they're incapable of certain higher processes regarding emotional awareness	2
I was careful to say that psychosis was a developmental disorder	2
that teenage reasoning only appears quasi-psychotic, but that it's not	2
And you can understand it, and do; which is why you're pissed	2
I had the courtesy to explain what you missed and why	2
which did include a current inability to anticipate consequences (which is in the linked Harvard study) and how changing your view was a part of growing up and why	2
If by that you mean I posted my own impressions like everybody else,	2
Yeah it's pretty important to not think what you think is wrong	2
There's not a lot of sense in thinking things you don't think are true	2
If you came up and said you hated black people I'd also assume you were relatively confident about it, too	2
Not exactly humble beliefs, are they	2
See, no emotional awareness	2
My posts.	2
Read them	2
It'll go well with you to be smarter than that	2
People smarter than you have a nasty habit of being a little proud and avoid conflict, and will just judge you when you tell them stuff like that, instead of taking the time to tell you why you're wrong	2
Few people are willing to correct even false facts these days, let alone patterns and assumptions	2
Also your view didn't anticipate the human element an iota	2
Once you learn what you don't know, you will have made a dent in knowledge akin to the damage a dove would do to a mountain if it few by lightly brushing it with the tip of its wing	2
In other words, it wouldn't be a drop in the ocean, so if you're squeamish about being ignorant you shouldn't have been born, because everybody is ignorant of most things	2
Fixing your thought patterns means you can be like an explorer who can take weirdness as it comes and be ready to deal with it, instead of having a tiff when you get called dumb for calling 55 million abortions a good thing with c.15 whole years of experience	2
sides are made by and for clergy and politicians, it wont do you any good	2
it is the topic you set, no	2
You truly are ridiculous	2
I had the courtesy to explain what you missed and why, which did include a current inability to anticipate consequences (which is in the linked Harvard study) and how changing your view was a part of growing up and why	2
Don't try and punish me for talking to you	2
Did you not even read any of this?	2
Did you not see the note that said that I was fishing for insight into the impact of 55 million abortions	2
?	2
You could have actually posed consequences to change my view	2
And Christ, you said you *had the courtesy to explain this to me*. Kid...	2
it was really tailored to challenge your reasoning style	2
You probably don't see yourself as having a predictable reasoning style(3)	2
This is the problem with X-factors and complexity(4)	2
You don't know what you don't know, you didn't know you didn't know my motivation, and you don't know that the 55 million abortions were a good thing(The point of the thread, no?), or what interests were operating in the establishment of them(The point of the thread, no?), or the consequences(The point of the thread, no?)	2
So far, the consequences are extremely negative for your generation(heck of a statement without an argument behind it)	2
I had reasoning behind my views, and was confident about the reasoning	2
came here in expectance that there was some reasoning that I had not yet considered which may change my opinion	2
You certainly weren't close to proving anything	2
People grow up learning different things, and get this, having different views	2
Then you go on to, instead of making an actual argument to prove me wrong, to say that I am not capable of holding these views without being inferior	2
Really, were you home-schooled	2
Your views are indicative of an angsty 20 year old who has not had much world exposure, one that wasn't weened until the age of 15	2
You also have special snowflake syndrome	2
All you do is sputter about whatever little information that you have while maintaining an illusion of superiority so that i'll trust how very *smart* you sound	2
I'm supposed to just accept your views without you proving them to be correct?	2
This explains how long-winded you are, its apart of the illusion	2
Also, your "Harvard studies, read them" was a pretty vain attempt of seeming more intelligent and of having more authority without adding anything new to the discussion	2
600 people would at least agree that it was an interesting thought.	2
Then why is this post so popular?	2
Visit the subreddit /r/iamverysmart to see your error	2
See: Dunning Krueger	2
Also, see the numerous other similar things you've said that don't actually contribute to the discussion, all you're doing is attempting to devalue the argument and myself.	2
CMV: America is a better place because of the 55 million abortions its had	1
These people would have been raised by their incompetent parents to drain down society, increase crime rates, suck up resources, and generally screw things up	1
Various ways to lower a resource negative population would have to be explored, if not because of this 55 million, then because of the next 55 million	1
One possibility is that there would be wars waged to try to kill them all, perhaps even with other countries with similar problems	1
Its a complicated issue	1
it would have been preferable to have our abortions alive	1
Perhaps the immigration of illegals is lowering the value of blue collar work and makes it harder for the borderline impoverished citizens to provide for their children	1
Its debatable how many women are having abortions due to financial reasons	1
This holds true even if illegal immigration is an overall plus to the countries value	1
Mexicans are the supreme race, native Americans will go extinct through abortion and then out-breeding.	1
this discussion is abstract enough to go into some weird places and that it is necessary to have a stopping point*	1
Is a more highly populated and economically productive America today going to result in an America tomorrow that can handle over population problems	1
would having a higher population from none-abortion just add on to the problems of a world going to shit	1
in an industrial society, its likely that these abortions would still be more productive than not	1
Then there was the debate as to whether or not a larger population with less resources per person is more innovative than a smaller one	1
This is to be considered if one is convinced that having a higher population coming from none-abortions results in a strain for resources in the country	1
Modern technology like the internet must be considered	1
One thing not calculated in the slightly psychotic weighing of the value of human life as "useful" is the sociological effect of the 55 million just gone	1
The attitude of human value as "what they [potentially] contributed to me/Exxon Mobile" is the spirit of eugenics and genocide, subjects often glorified on reddit.	1
It's the same problem with war	1
its no longer viewed as a hostile or paranoid thing to do	1
>It becomes a recursive loop and generates a hostile attitude towards foreigners and other countries	1
>This works on the inverse too	1
When we went to the moon, our horizons and view of mankind changed	1
Once we better understood such objects, nature worship definitely changed	1
it was once normal for religions to kill masses of unbelievers	1
The Zeitgeist changes, as people's attitudes adjust to new information and ways of life and problem solving	1
This Zeitgeist concept is the same problem with the public school	1
intelligence is reduced to reciting what one is told to a high degree of accuracy and memorization	1
in reality, everything is true/untrue depending on it's level of resolution or accuracy	1
they're declared intelligent or not, and implicitly worthwhile or not	1
The many nuances of intelligence, higher forms of intelligence, varieties of people, and bigger issues like antisocial personality disorder and social skills, are virtually ignored during the developmental period for the "efficient" cattle model	1
the worst thing is not that	1
The general attitude among the adult population is "don't think too much"	1
you're also treated to relaxed attitudes towards eugenics and genocide, and all the warped views of human value and what a "better place" is that come with it	1
only that benefits would exist and it's our job to weigh those against the costs always	1
You're mistaking what I believe to be a good outcome as different from what you believe to be a good outcome	1
I am in no way claiming that either one of those imaginary futures would result from having legal/illegal abortion	1
My point is that a responsible today allows for a better future	1
Decisions like whether or not the non-existence of 55 million people provides to the greater good have to be faced, such as you said	1
Your claim is that the conscious acceptance of deaths providing logistical benefits is damaging to our perception of the value of human life	1
That is true	1
such sentiment should be properly weighed by someone attempting to assess whether or not these 55 million abortions have had a positive outcome	1
This should not overtake their thinking and drown out the other considerations	1
I believe you are in agreement with that	1
you take the Zeitgeist as pretty much the highest consideration	1
This is where we disagree.	1
I was only illustrating a hidden and relatable X-factor to get you to open up within your own assumptions and realize [how many other X-factors might exist,](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/2rj2bt/50_of_nigeriens_are_under_14_years_old_in/cngsdvf) and to encourage more caution towards unforeseen consequences and butterfly effects	1
See, psychotic behavior is retarded literally	1
It comes from a lack of emotional sense and is a developmental disorder	1
giving you the socio-political consequences of 55 million people missing might change your view	1
You might adjust your facts, but not expand your perspective	1
the reason people are highly sensitive [emotionally] is the same reason you'd turn up the sensitivity dial of a camera, microphone, or any other sensor	1
you didn't anticipate it, but thought you did, didn't you	1
You said I gave the Zeitgeist explanation because it was my best	1
You probably don't see yourself as having a predictable reasoning style	1
This is the problem with X-factors and complexity	1
the consequences are extremely negative for your generation	1
i'm emotionally retarded, and instead of giving into my nature and letting my thought process be masturbated from a more standard answer, you're subjecting me to therapy by trying to illustrate that such views are had by inferior humans	1
These illustrations very clearly show that you are attempting for me to change my view based on your argument that I am inferior	1
As for your concluding paragraph, it is complete nonsense	1
I don't know where in this thread that I was *very confident* in my views	1
Really, your argument is absolutely ludacris	1
I think not! you need to expand your perspective to not even consider such things!	1
Its rather ironic that you are peddling how emotionally retarded I am	1
I like that.	1
So personal; very theatrical	1
I'm pretty sure that's how everybody's mind works at all times	1
I find your passive aggressiveness and focus on superiority and inferiority to be low	1
To change your view, they inevitably have to think you're wrong on some level of analysis	1
Teens are still developing, you know	1
I didn't tell you to change your view because you're inferior	1
yeah	1
I think you're describing your feelings of how all the other posts were dwarfed in your opinion and are in my post's shadow, and how you hate it	1
Well my post was about being wrong as an asset to learning things	1
Most folks don't claim to have extreme views unless they have an unhealthy degree of misguided confidence in them	1
You don't understand the signals you're sending, and get upset when folks read between the lines because you put the wrong information between them--likely true information	1
You probably really do believe America is a better place because of the 55 million abortions its had, and you probably see how shallow and dumb that is in retrospect	1
It's good that you've distanced yourself from your view in saying you're not that confident in it	1
Most people would have thought that, and would have been satisfied to ignore you for this very reason and not respond	1
I think it's working	1
I think your rage is death throes of a bad way of thinking	1
It's Dunning-Kruger	1
that was a lapse in emotion that revealed your age	1
because you're going to readjust a lot	1
Best to find out how to deal with information instead of trying to be "right"	1
I wouldn't say you shot holes in my idea, more so that you used an unnecessary amount of time and effort to make a few simple points	1
Most minds don't work in such a way that they have to ignore information to function	1
The claim that one has to be emotionally retarded to have such a thought is ridiculous	1
you seem to have been made mad by my comment and then put anger into the rest of your response	1
Perhaps it is shallow	1
Of course, but that doesn't mean that I have to agree with you when I see you as wrong	1
I absolutely expected to be chewed alive for every fallacy I had	1
What I was *annoyed* by were your unfounded and arrogant assumptions	1
You claim i'm too underdeveloped to argue with, I should just accept your view, flush my brain of such thoughts, and continue about my day	1
I didn't tell you to change your view because you're inferior	1
That was the entire point of my CMV	1
Anyway, that's why I gave that explanation, and you didn't anticipate it, but thought you did, didn't you?	1
You said I gave the Zeitgeist explanation because it was my best	1
A little self important eh?	1
You seem to be quasi-psychotic	1
Rambling on	1
First of all, your comments, under your own description of the Dunning Krueger effect, have some serious ass Dunning Krueger	1
I came here to learn	1
I came here expecting myself to be proven wrong	1
Having a thought, however morbid and efficient, is not enough to indicate a lack of emotional intelligence	1
I'm not going to *abandon* a view, i'm going to be presented with new information that changes my mind.	1
Again, instead of making actual arguments, all you're doing is to attempt to devalue me and the idea	1
You're one of those people you imply?	1
this intellectual has blessed me with correcting my false facts! I should be thankful!	1
Its like you say the same thing over and over again and make it as convoluted as possible	1
Isn't this another one of those places where you were supposed to contribute to the discussion rather than doing your *i'm an intellectual* masturbation?	1
I'm susceptible to politics and religion because I disagree with you.	1
CMV: America is a better place because of the 55 million abortions its had	0
http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rd7mg/cmv_america_is_a_better_place_because_of_the_55/	0
There have been 55 million abortions in the US since 1973.	0
Something in the ballpark of 45% of women who have abortions have more than one abortion.	0
These people would have been raised by their incompetent parents to drain down society, increase crime rates, suck up resources, and generally screw things up.	0
Various ways to lower a resource negative population would have to be explored, if not because of this 55 million, then because of the next 55 million.	0
One possibility is that there would be wars waged to try to kill them all, perhaps even with other countries with similar problems.	0
Waging war to purposefully lower population, even with a country facing similar issues, would cost not only resources, but it would also cause political, cultural, and global issues.	0
America's innovation and education rankings would be lower.	0
Every middle-class child in the country would receive a lower quality education if there were 55 million more around.	0
(**Note:**I'm not trying to hear arguments on the ethics of abortion, its a banal argument that everyone and their mother has had at one point, what I am really fishing for is insight into what the country would look like with those 55 million around.	0
Would we adapt to the population and make good use of each of them?)	0
**Was view changed?**	0
Its a complicated issue.	0
Without the extra population from abortions, has there been proportionately more immigration to fill labor needs, or are the millions of illegals from Mexico as likely to be so numerous even if there was a higher none-abortion population?	0
Doesn't immigration of a working class citizen on such a massive scale cause dissonance in a country more so than it does cultural exchange, meaning that it would have been preferable to have our abortions alive?	0
Or are we talking about a population so huge that race and national identity are insignificant, that there is always going to be a huge amount of hostility between different demographics?	0
-(choppy writing, but i'm on 3 hours of sleep and stretched for time, give me a break)-	0
(Side thought: Perhaps the immigration of illegals is lowering the value of blue collar work and makes it harder for the borderline impoverished citizens to provide for their children.	0
Its debatable how many women are having abortions due to financial reasons, but surely its a significant number, so how many of these women wouldn't be having financial troubles if there wasn't competition from cheap illegal labor to keep wages lower?	0
This holds true even if illegal immigration is an overall plus to the countries value.	0
Conclusion: Mexicans are the supreme race, native Americans will go extinct through abortion and then out-breeding. *no that isn't a serious sentiment,	0
i'm just saying, this discussion is abstract enough to go into some weird places and that it is necessary to have a stopping point* )	0
Then there is the next question.	0
Is a more highly populated and economically productive America today going to result in an America tomorrow that can handle over population problems, or would having a higher population from none-abortion just add on to the problems of a world going to shit?	0
Similar: An aborted fetus is likely to have been a less productive person than a never-considered-for-abortion fetus, but in an industrial society, its likely that these abortions would still be more productive than not.	0
Then there was the debate as to whether or not a larger population with less resources per person is more innovative than a smaller one.	0
This is to be considered if one is convinced that having a higher population coming from none-abortions results in a strain for resources in the country.	0
Modern technology like the internet must be considered.	0
Yes, my view was changed, but not into the polar opposite.	0
I am now confused and lost.	0
**EDIT:**	0
I'll be without internet for a few days.	0
I may end up returning and responding more but it won't be anytime soon.	0
This was my first post to CMV.	0
I apologize for a few things that I did that could be considered *rude* around here.	0
I also see a few times where I got redundant.	0
Thank you all for your arguments.	0
This is a very critical place, I hope to learn how to better use it and come here more often.	0
I feel I could learn a lot here.	0
One thing not calculated in the slightly psychotic weighing of the value of human life as "useful" is the sociological effect of the 55 million just gone: A Zeitgeist wherein 55 million abortions is weighed as good for industry or not, the resulting thinking it good on account of efficiency, as certain citizens look on themselves and others as a figure or livestock.	0
The attitude of human value as "what they [potentially] contributed to me/Exxon Mobile" is the spirit of eugenics and genocide, subjects often glorified on reddit.	0
It's the same problem with war: Once killing foreigners is an acceptable/inevitable means to profit and expand, you find that attitudes exposed to such behavior change with it.	0
>Other countries also build militaries to do so and to "defend" against each other, and its no longer viewed as a hostile or paranoid thing to do because everybody's doing it and so must do it.	0
>It becomes a recursive loop and generates a hostile attitude towards foreigners and other countries.	0
>This works on the inverse too.	0
When we went to the moon, our horizons and view of mankind changed.	0
Once we better understood such objects, nature worship definitely changed.	0
You'll be hard-pressed to find moon worshipers today, and the "religions of the book" may be going out of style as highly literate people have access to more historical data and the time to translate The Bible, Torah, and Quran in context for themselves.	0
Also, it was once normal for religions to kill masses of unbelievers; now it's seen as wrong, even by the religions themselves.	0
The Zeitgeist changes, as people's attitudes adjust to new information and ways of life and problem solving.	0
This Zeitgeist concept is the same problem with the public school.	0
In it, intelligence is reduced to reciting what one is told to a high degree of accuracy and memorization, data treated as "fact" or "fiction" (in reality, everything is true/untrue depending on it's level of resolution or accuracy), children are moved through by age, graded literally on the same scale as a meat product, and bells move them around.	0
On this, they're declared intelligent or not, and implicitly worthwhile or not.	0
The many nuances of intelligence, higher forms of intelligence, varieties of people, and bigger issues like antisocial personality disorder and social skills, are virtually ignored during the developmental period for the "efficient" cattle model.	0
Good meat or bad meat, instead of people with a variety of skill potential and problems.	0
We end up with McEducation literally, with a lot of "product" to be "thrown away" and that seen as okay; but the worst thing is not that, but the Zeitgeist within society that people should be "grown", and graded, and that these categories are accurate.	0
Consequential attitudes include the idea that information will be bestowed to us like our teachers did, that it's "true" or not and that "truth" is available to us in an absolute way, and that smart people are cooperative.	0
Political parties appeal to these learned biases.	0
The general attitude among the adult population is "don't think too much", because it's seen as disruptive, problem-making, and culturally odious, and taking sides on trust is often seen as a good thing.	0
So with 55 million abortions, you're also treated to relaxed attitudes towards eugenics and genocide, and all the warped views of human value and what a "better place" is that come with it.	0
Decisions are give-and-take and has benefits as well as problems.	0
You see, there would have certainly been benefits to a preemptive tactical nuclear strike against the USSR, and costs too.	0
Anybody who denies either is blinded by zeal, and I'm not saying such a strike would have been worth it, only that benefits would exist and it's our job to weigh those against the costs always.	0
If you cannot see the cost of the 55 million abortions, it means that you should immediately change your view so you can experience the other side of your thinking, which has hijacked your perception and mistaken itself for truth recursively.	0
You're mistaking what I believe to be a good outcome as different from what you believe to be a good outcome.	0
Think America in 1000 years.	0
This America faced a sustainable growth rate.	0
Imagine this country to be populated by billions of faces.	0
Pretend that technology has reached such a point that any human can pursue any passion they wish.	0
These Americans can go enjoy the wilderness of a terraformed planet (or use their immortality to wait until that is possible), enter a virtual reality program and experience any event by any person in history as if it was true, go see dinosaurs at the zoo, pursue as many doctorates as they'd like, increase or decrease their intelligence, and never have to work a day of their lives to earn such privileges.	0
Now imagine America in 200 years.	0
Babies were created indiscriminately.	0
The quality of education regressed and then stagnated to that of the year 1970.	0
Even with new technology, having enough drinking water and arable land is becoming an issue.	0
Everything is polluted to hell.	0
The wealth gap is a factor of ten worse.	0
The perception of the value of human life goes to zero.	0
(I am in no way claiming that either one of those imaginary futures would result from having legal/illegal abortion.	0
My point is that a responsible today allows for a better future.	0
My illustrations are ridiculous )	0
Decisions like whether or not the non-existence of 55 million people provides to the greater good have to be faced, such as you said.	0
Your claim is that the conscious acceptance of deaths providing logistical benefits is damaging to our perception of the value of human life.	0
That is true, and such sentiment should be properly weighed by someone attempting to assess whether or not these 55 million abortions have had a positive outcome.	0
This should not overtake their thinking and drown out the other considerations.	0
I believe you are in agreement with that.	0
However, you take the Zeitgeist as pretty much the highest consideration.	0
This is where we disagree.	0
I believe in a shittier today for a better tomorrow, such as how our ancestors had miserable and productive lives that ended up with us living to be 80 and fat.	0
I also don't think that the connection between poor education tactics and the "don't think too much" mentalities can be drawn between the zeitgeist claims you're making.	0
If the quality of life is higher, you'll see higher quality education and the available resources for more to be able to think and live as as they'd like.	0
If the quality of life is lower, you'll see people working miserable jobs just to be able to eat dinner, the only way to avoid depression would be to not think too much.	0
Having a low quality of life results in a poor Zeitgeist.	0
>I believe you are in agreement with that. However, you take the Zeitgeist as pretty much the highest consideration. This is where we disagree. I believe in a shittier today for a better tomorrow, such as how our ancestors had miserable and productive lives that ended up with us living to be 80 and fat.	0
No, I was only illustrating a hidden and relatable X-factor to get you to open up within your own assumptions and realize [how many other X-factors might exist,](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/2rj2bt/50_of_nigeriens_are_under_14_years_old_in/cngsdvf) and to encourage more caution towards unforeseen consequences and butterfly effects.	0
I chose this approach because your view is highly cerebral and overconfident, seemingly unconcerned with potential consequence, and repackaging gross oversimplification and naive callous as bright utilitarianism (no offense).	0
I wanted to offer an example that had to do with people, instead of indulging your quasi-psychotic reasoning.	0
See, psychotic behavior is retarded literally: It comes from a lack of emotional sense and is a developmental disorder. I'm telling you this because you're probably a teen and will grow out of it by interacting with people like you are, and having them challenge you and show disgust.	0
Psychotics are developmentally stunted because they're antisocial, even when they're around people, and so they never change their view and only develop a 7-year-old view from a little monster into a big monster.	0
That said, giving you the socio-political consequences of 55 million people missing might change your view, but the stupid and shallow premises would remain untouched.	0
You might adjust your facts, but not expand your perspective.	0
See, the reason people are highly sensitive [emotionally] is the same reason you'd turn up the sensitivity dial of a camera, microphone, or any other sensor: Because you're concerned you'll miss something, and are aware of the dangers of missing something.	0
The mind and emotions operate like extremely complex equipment.	0
This is why some people are very squeamish; myself not included.	0
Contrarily, when a person is very confident, it's [almost never because they're on a higher tier of information or understanding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect), but because they don't even know that they don't know.	0
In the case of cold utility, often peddled by teens as very novel because life and the self seems very simple to them, because they've such a low tier of contact with the world that it can look simple from a distance.	0
It's why we recruit teens into the military.	0
They're very easy to trick and convince to shoot a guy in a field for wearing different clothes without asking a lot of questions or thinking too hard about consequences.	0
Anyway, that's why I gave that explanation, and you didn't anticipate it, but thought you did, didn't you?	0
You said I gave the Zeitgeist explanation because it was my best, but it was really tailored to challenge your reasoning style.	0
You probably don't see yourself as having a predictable reasoning style.	0
This is the problem with X-factors and complexity.	0
You don't know what you don't know, you didn't know you didn't know my motivation, and you don't know that the 55 million abortions were a good thing, or what interests were operating in the establishment of them, or the consequences.	0
So far, the consequences are extremely negative for your generation.	0
Essentially, i'm emotionally retarded, and instead of giving into my nature and letting my thought process be masturbated from a more standard answer, you're subjecting me to therapy by trying to illustrate that such views are had by inferior humans?	0
My inferior mind must be shown new views in order for me to see how wrong my initial view is? (teens tricked into joining the military, developmentally stunted, antisocial.	0
These illustrations very clearly show that you are attempting for me to change my view based on your argument that I am inferior. )	0
As for your concluding paragraph, it is complete nonsense.	0
There is an assumption every other sentence with the remaining sentences being filled with assertions that you have not been backed with well-founded arguments.	0
You completely circumvented every single debate being had in this thread and proceeded to ejaculate your rather arrogant assumptions all over the place .	0
It seems that you can barely fathom that you *may* be wrong, that you are too intelligent to have to provide any adequate reasoning for yourself.	0
Also, I don't know where in this thread that I was *very confident* in my views.	0
On the contrary to the Dunning-Krueger effect you are implying that I face, I am very critical of myself and feel incompetent in areas where others rate me as competent.	0
I have not said a single thing in this thread that i've been absolutely sure of.	0
Really, your argument is absolutely ludacris.	0
It boils down to a well constructed shitpost.	0
*those abortions may have been a good thing?	0
you can have that thought??	0
* **you are a retard!** *argue about whether or not these abortions have had a benefit to the country?	0
I think not! you need to expand your perspective to not even consider such things!*	0
Its rather ironic that you are peddling how emotionally retarded I am, yet how you spent the past two comments trying to classify me, inform me of my inadequacies, *subtly be a superior human being*, and also fall under what seems to be the Dunning-Krueger effect yourself.	0
>Essentially, i'm emotionally retarded, and instead of giving into my nature and letting my thought process be masturbated from a more standard answer, you're subjecting me to therapy by trying to illustrate that such views are had by inferior humans?	0
Therapy.	0
I like that.	0
So personal; very theatrical.	0
Can I comment on your inferior reasoning and why it's inferior without it being a big deal?	0
This is Change My View.	0
Did you expect people to *not* shoot holes in your reasoning?	0
> My inferior mind must be shown new views in order for me to see how wrong my initial view is?	0
I'm pretty sure that's how everybody's mind works at all times, and that I said that, and you know that :)	0
I find your passive aggressiveness and focus on superiority and inferiority to be low.	0
I'd of liked this to have been mature, and you probably should have anticipated people finding your worldview to be wrong on CMV.	0
To change your view, they inevitably have to think you're wrong on some level of analysis.	0
Didn't you anticipate your apparent reasoning to be challenged in the least?	0
Or did I do it too offensively well?	0
> Teens tricked into joining the military, developmentally stunted, antisocial. These illustrations very clearly show that you are attempting for me to change my view based on your argument that I am inferior	0
Teens are still developing, you know.	0
There's [plenty of research](http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog-extra/the-adolescent-brain-beyond-raging-hormones) supporting that their minds aren't fully developed and that they're incapable of certain higher processes regarding emotional awareness.	0
Also I was careful to say that psychosis was a developmental disorder, and that teenage reasoning only appears quasi-psychotic, but that it's not, in explaining how people think emotionally and why in a way you could understand.	0
And you can understand it, and do; which is why you're pissed.	0
I didn't tell you to change your view because you're inferior, and I had the courtesy to explain what you missed and why, which did include a current inability to anticipate consequences (which is in the linked Harvard study) and how changing your view was a part of growing up and why.	0
Don't try and punish me for talking to you.	0
> As for your concluding paragraph, it is complete nonsense. There is an assumption every other sentence with the remaining sentences being filled with assertions that you have not been backed with well-founded arguments.	0
Name one.	0
> You completely circumvented every single debate being had in this thread and proceeded to ejaculate your rather arrogant assumptions all over the place	0
If by that you mean I posted my own impressions like everybody else,yeah.	0
I think you're describing your feelings of how all the other posts were dwarfed in your opinion and are in my post's shadow, and how you hate it.	0
I like the implied sexual dominance part.	0
I'll take the ejaculating comment and agree on that.	0
I really did pound your thread pretty hard with thoughts, and I liked it.	0
> It seems that you can barely fathom that you *may* be wrong, that you are too intelligent to have to provide any adequate reasoning for yourself.	0
Well my post was about being wrong as an asset to learning things, but let's not spit hairs.	0
Yeah it's pretty important to not think what you think is wrong.	0
There's not a lot of sense in thinking things you don't think are true.	0
> Also, I don't know where in this thread that I was *very confident* in my views.

Most folks don't claim to have extreme views unless they have an unhealthy degree of misguided confidence in them.	0
At least enough confidence to have the gull to say it.	0
If you came up and said you hated black people I'd also assume you were relatively confident about it, too.	0
Not exactly humble beliefs, are they.	0
See, no emotional awareness. Harvard study.	0
My posts.	0
Read them.	0
You don't understand the signals you're sending, and get upset when folks read between the lines because you put the wrong information between them--likely true information.	0
You probably really do believe America is a better place because of the 55 million abortions its had, and you probably see how shallow and dumb that is in retrospect.	0
It's good that you've distanced yourself from your view in saying you're not that confident in it.	0
It's one step closer to abandoning it.	0
> Really, your argument is absolutely ludacris. It boils down to a well constructed shitpost.	0
:D	0
> *those abortions may have been a good thing? you can have that thought??* **you are a retard!** *argue about whether or not these abortions have had a benefit to the country? I think not! you need to expand your perspective to not even consider such things!*	0
Most people would have thought that, and would have been satisfied to ignore you for this very reason and not respond.	0
I did anticipate this, and I'm not doing it to troll, but I really do want to change your view--more specifically, that sort of thinking.	0
It'll go well with you to be smarter than that.	0
I think it's working.	0
I think your rage is death throes of a bad way of thinking.	0
Enjoy it.	0
People smarter than you have a nasty habit of being a little proud and avoid conflict, and will just judge you when you tell them stuff like that, instead of taking the time to tell you why you're wrong.	0
Few people are willing to correct even false facts these days, let alone patterns and assumptions.	0
> Its rather ironic that you are peddling how emotionally retarded I am, yet how you spent the past two comments trying to classify me, inform me of my inadequacies, *subtly be a superior human being,* and also fall under what seems to be the Dunning-Krueger effect yourself	0
It's Dunning-Kruger.	0
Also your view didn't anticipate the human element an iota, and that was a lapse in emotion that revealed your age.	0
Once you learn what you don't know, you will have made a dent in knowledge akin to the damage a dove would do to a mountain if it few by lightly brushing it with the tip of its wing.	0
In other words, it wouldn't be a drop in the ocean, so if you're squeamish about being ignorant you shouldn't have been born, because everybody is ignorant of most things.	0
Fixing your thought patterns means you can be like an explorer who can take weirdness as it comes and be ready to deal with it, instead of having a tiff when you get called dumb for calling 55 million abortions a good thing with c.15 whole years of experience.	0
As for you, fix those thought patterns and get used to it, because you're going to readjust a lot.	0
Best to find out how to deal with information instead of trying to be "right", because sides are made by and for clergy and politicians, it wont do you any good.	0
> Therapy. I like that. So personal; very theatrical. Can I comment on your inferior reasoning and why it's inferior without it being a big deal? This is Change My View. Did you expect people to not shoot holes in your reasoning? If my reasoning is inferior, than prove the original view along with the logic behind it wrong. Its that simple .	0
I wouldn't say you shot holes in my idea, more so that you used an unnecessary amount of time and effort to make a few simple points.	0
> I'm pretty sure that's how everybody's mind works at all times, and that I said that, and you know that :)	0
Most minds don't work in such a way that they have to ignore information to function.	0
The claim that one has to be emotionally retarded to have such a thought is ridiculous.	0
":)"	0
you seem to have been made mad by my comment and then put anger into the rest of your response.	0
> I find your passive aggressiveness and focus on superiority and inferiority to be low.	0
Perhaps it is shallow, but it is the topic you set, no?	0
> I'd of liked this to have been mature, and you probably should have anticipated people finding your worldview to be wrong on CMV. To change your view, they inevitably have to think you're wrong on some level of analysis.	0
Of course, but that doesn't mean that I have to agree with you when I see you as wrong.	0
> Didn't you anticipate your apparent reasoning to be challenged in the least? Or did I do it too offensively well?	0
I absolutely expected to be chewed alive for every fallacy I had.	0
What I was *annoyed* by were your unfounded and arrogant assumptions.	0

There's plenty of research supporting that their minds aren't fully developed and that they're incapable of certain higher processes regarding emotional awareness.

There you go again.	0
You claim i'm too underdeveloped to argue with, I should just accept your view, flush my brain of such thoughts, and continue about my day.	0
You truly are ridiculous.	0

I didn't tell you to change your view because you're inferior, and I had the courtesy to explain what you missed and why, which did include a current inability to anticipate consequences (which is in the linked Harvard study) and how changing your view was a part of growing up and why.	0
Don't try and punish me for talking to you.	0
I'm not anticipating consequences?	0
That was the entire point of my CMV.	0
Did you not even read any of this?	0
Did you not see the note that said that I was fishing for insight into the impact of 55 million abortions	0
? You could have actually posed consequences to change my view.	0
And Christ, you said you *had the courtesy to explain this to me*. Kid...	0

Anyway, that's why I gave that explanation, and you didn't anticipate it, but thought you did, didn't you? (1) You said I gave the Zeitgeist explanation because it was my best(2), but it was really tailored to challenge your reasoning style.	0
You probably don't see yourself as having a predictable reasoning style(3).	0
This is the problem with X-factors and complexity(4).	0
You don't know what you don't know, you didn't know you didn't know my motivation, and you don't know that the 55 million abortions were a good thing(The point of the thread, no?), or what interests were operating in the establishment of them(The point of the thread, no?), or the consequences(The point of the thread, no?).	0

If you came up and said you hated black people I'd also assume you were relatively confident about it, too. Not exactly humble beliefs, are they.	0
First of all, your comments, under your own description of the Dunning Krueger effect, have some serious ass Dunning Krueger.	0
Second of all, I had reasoning behind my views, and was confident about the reasoning, but came here in expectance that there was some reasoning that I had not yet considered which may change my opinion.	0
I came here to learn.	0
I came here expecting myself to be proven wrong.	0
You certainly weren't close to proving anything.	0
> See, no emotional awareness. Harvard study. My posts. Read them. You don't understand the signals you're sending, and get upset when folks read between the lines because you put the wrong information between them--likely true information.	0
Having a thought, however morbid and efficient, is not enough to indicate a lack of emotional intelligence.	0
People grow up learning different things, and get this, having different views.	0
Then you go on to, instead of making an actual argument to prove me wrong, to say that I am not capable of holding these views without being inferior.	0
Really, were you home-schooled?	0
Your views are indicative of an angsty 20 year old who has not had much world exposure, one that wasn't weened until the age of 15.	0
You also have special snowflake syndrome.	0
All you do is sputter about whatever little information that you have while maintaining an illusion of superiority so that i'll trust how very *smart* you sound.	0
I'm supposed to just accept your views without you proving them to be correct?	0
This explains how long-winded you are, its apart of the illusion.	0
Also, your "Harvard studies, read them" was a pretty vain attempt of seeming more intelligent and of having more authority without adding anything new to the discussion.	0
> You probably really do believe America is a better place because of the 55 million abortions its had	0
Read: post title.	0
> and you probably see how shallow and dumb that is in retrospect.	0
600 people would at least agree that it was an interesting thought.	0
> It's good that you've distanced yourself from your view in saying you're not that confident in it. It's one step closer to abandoning it.	0
I'm not going to *abandon* a view, i'm going to be presented with new information that changes my mind.	0
> Most people would have thought that, and would have been satisfied to ignore you for this very reason and not respond.	0
Oh?	0
Then why is this post so popular?	0
Again, instead of making actual arguments, all you're doing is to attempt to devalue me and the idea.	0
> I did anticipate this, and I'm not doing it to troll, but I really do want to change your view--more specifically, that sort of thinking. It'll go well with you to be smarter than that.	0

You're one of those people you imply?	0
See: Dunning Krueger.	0
Also, see the numerous other similar things you've said that don't actually contribute to the discussion, all you're doing is attempting to devalue the argument and myself.	0

There would be even stronger calls for an anti-islam and anti-immigration policies.	2
These event reminds people that they cannot depend on protection by government.	2
Say if 1 out of 5 people carried a gun with them, was well trained in its use and tested in his responsibility to prevent its misuse	2
society upheld the value of these people as protectors, it would benefit the society more the the current state of legislature and culture of gun ownership in most of European countries	2
as policemen are a very homogeneous group trained to stick together and the danger of even deepening the "not one of us" (pack) mentality and escalation of "police state"	2
If increasing gun ownership would benefit society, would there be a point where if X number of people owned and carried a gun, there would be no shootings at all?	2
How do the stats stack up in support of your view?	2
I dunno,they have a reputation for misuse?	2
Distinguish between decreasing and stopping, owning and responsibly owning, laws and culture...	2
CMV: I think the Paris shooting makes a good case for culture of responsible gun ownership any carrying.	1
I think France is in a tough spot in how to react to this.	1
I think it would be a shame to allow the many, who are afraid more then anything, to be swayed by xenophobic nationalists (which might have been the goal of the attack anyway).	1
I think this, regardless of whether the weapons used by the attackers were owned legally, makes a good case for promoting a culture of a reasonable gun ownership and carrying.	1
I also think this would be much better then increase in police numbers and rights	1
Are you suggesting that INCREASING the number of weapons would decrease the lethal use of those weapons?	1
It MIGHT help mitigate one instance of shootings, like today's in Paris	1
surely tempt or instigate more occurrences in its place as the weapons are that much easier to access and use?	1
This seems like a very difficult thing to prove or disprove either way because of the lack of research	1
I'm loathed to suggest increasing gun ownership could be a possible solution	1
Surely, LESS would be better?	1
No I'm not claiming this.	1

There have been 55 million abortions in the US since 1973	2
Something in the ballpark of 45% of women who have abortions have more than one abortion	2
Waging war to purposefully lower population, even with a country facing similar issues, would cost not only resources, but it would also cause political, cultural, and global issues	2
America's innovation and education rankings would be lower	2
Every middle-class child in the country would receive a lower quality education if there were 55 million more around	2
Without the extra population from abortions, has there been proportionately more immigration to fill labor needs, or are the millions of illegals from Mexico as likely to be so numerous even if there was a higher none-abortion population	2
Doesn't immigration of a working class citizen on such a massive scale cause dissonance in a country more so than it does cultural exchange	2
Or are we talking about a population so huge that race and national identity are insignificant, that there is always going to be a huge amount of hostility between different demographics	2
surely its a significant number	2
how many of these women wouldn't be having financial troubles if there wasn't competition from cheap illegal labor to keep wages lower	2
An aborted fetus is likely to have been a less productive person than a never-considered-for-abortion fetus	2
55 million chances to do so isn't a bad place to start.	2

CMV: America is a better place because of the 55 million abortions its had	1
These people would have been raised by their incompetent parents to drain down society, increase crime rates, suck up resources, and generally screw things up	1
Various ways to lower a resource negative population would have to be explored, if not because of this 55 million, then because of the next 55 million	1
One possibility is that there would be wars waged to try to kill them all, perhaps even with other countries with similar problems	1
Its a complicated issue	1
it would have been preferable to have our abortions alive	1
Perhaps the immigration of illegals is lowering the value of blue collar work and makes it harder for the borderline impoverished citizens to provide for their children	1
Its debatable how many women are having abortions due to financial reasons	1
This holds true even if illegal immigration is an overall plus to the countries value	1
Mexicans are the supreme race, native Americans will go extinct through abortion and then out-breeding.	1
this discussion is abstract enough to go into some weird places and that it is necessary to have a stopping point*	1
Is a more highly populated and economically productive America today going to result in an America tomorrow that can handle over population problems	1
would having a higher population from none-abortion just add on to the problems of a world going to shit	1
in an industrial society, its likely that these abortions would still be more productive than not	1
Then there was the debate as to whether or not a larger population with less resources per person is more innovative than a smaller one	1
This is to be considered if one is convinced that having a higher population coming from none-abortions results in a strain for resources in the country	1

I have a [source](http://www.guttmacher.org/media/nr/2010/05/04/index.html) that shows that abortions are typically (and in some years, mostly) had by people without enough wealth to care for there kids.	2
Some stats for example include "31% of women obtaining abortions are in school; 68% of women who have abortions are employed."	2
"33% of women who obtain abortions have family incomes under $11,000 annually, 11% of abortions are obtained by women whose household incomes are $50,000 or more."	2
that means the majority of those having abortions have income between $11,000 and $55,000, which is above the Federal Poverty line.	2
It could be about finances but could just be too soon for a woman to go through again.	2
Pregnancy is hard on the body and far riskier than an abortion performed within a few weeks.	2

and i won't lie, people will see a reduction in what they are able to buy, but when you balance that out with perpetual unemployment its still better then the alternative.	0

Communism has some flaws , but it has also had a long time for people to find solutions to those flaws,	0

the some few people that still know how to hunt and gather would probably survive as well people who were rich enough to have access to a lot of resources to start out with before the economy crashes.	2

Therefore, there will always be a market for meat and other animal products	2
Since the majority of farms are large factory farms	2
this practice would be much easier to "evangelize" than a vegetarian or vegan diet.	2
Face it, meat is tasty (and non-factory meat is often tastier than factory-farmed meat, at least in my own anecdotal experience)	2
People will always want meat and the market will always provide it.	2
Vegan that truly believes that they are directly helping animals by not eating meat are deluding themselves.	2
I believe that animals are being treated cruelly. because of this, I will not eat meat."	2
It's a bit like not going to a restaurant because they came out against a belief of yours.	2
If you believe in gay rights, you may decide not to go to chick-fil-a because of your belief.	2
Do you really believe that you not giving business will help in any way?	2
You just want to make a statement.	2

CMV: Veganism and vegetarianism are not the best way to improve farm animal welfare	1
The chances of the entire world adopting a vegan/vegetarian diet are slim to none	1
The food market, like all other markets, operates on general principles of supply and demand	1
Meat farmers can use techniques exhibiting a range of costs or benefits, both in terms of environmental impact and animal welfare.	1
A vegan or vegetarian diet denies demand, and thus potential revenue, to all meat-producing farms, regardless of how humane or environmentally sound their practice are.	1
I concede that this is probably good for animal welfare.	1
Purchasing meat from farms known to produce their meat in an ethical way not only denies demand to large factory farms	1
helps improve the market share of ethical meat-growing	1
which seems as though it would be even better for animal welfare.	1
My general view is that people should probably as a rule eat less meat from better growers	1
that will make for a bigger shift in growing practices than simply people dropping out of eating meat altogether.	1
Vegans decide not to eat meat because they want to make a statement about something they believe in, not necessarily because they want to improve animal welfare	1
they likely do want to improve animal welfare	1
As you already pointed out, becoming a vegan has little to no affect on animal welfare.	1
Most vegans eat their burgers without beef because they want to make a statement.	1
no, you don't.	1

you misinterpret the true motivation of vegans	1

Someone going vegan and someone becoming an ethical carnivore reduce demand for factory-farmed meat by exactly the same amount (1 person).	1

Face it, meat is tasty (and non-factory meat is often tastier than factory-farmed meat, at least in my own anecdotal experience)	0
It really depends on how you view animal welfare.	0
I think most vegetarians see killing and eating an animal as wrong regardless of how good the conditions it lives in are.	0
I guess that this comes from my utilitarian-in-most-cases ethics.	0
I believe that small-medium improvements over large scales, such as an entire market, are better than large improvements at tiny scales.	0
Moreover, this CMV is not about "veganism and vegetarianism are bad" it's about "eating meat responsibly is better for animal welfare than abstaining from eating meat"	0
According to the theory of evolution it makes more sense that the egg preceded the chicken	2
Before the chicken there was a similar but different creature.	2
Let's call it X.	2
Its completely arbitrary when the X officially evolved into a chicken	2
at some point it does	2
An X, not a chicken lays the first chicken egg.	2
The chicken, as far as we know came into existence around [2500-2100 BC.]	2
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken#Origins)	2
Egg bearing animals, however, seem to be [as old as the dinosuars]	2
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_egg)	2
From this, we can conclude that the egg came first.	2
My comment was a silly way to point out a flaw in your post.	2
It wasn't an actual argument.	2
CMV The EGG came first before the chicken.	1
The chicken egg comes before any creature considered a chicken exist.	1
If we are being really technical, we can confidently say that the egg came first.	1
^Unless ^you ^are ^talking ^about ^the ^CHICKEN ^egg ^vs ^the ^chicken, ^in ^which ^case ^I ^have ^no ^clue.	1
While the question doesn't specifically say a chicken egg, I think that argument is kind of silly.	1

Saying these people shouldnt be allowed to become part of the country, is the same as saying they are worse,	2
because they were born on a different side of a line	2
americans are better because of the side of the line they are born on	2
This is prominent in many ads and political champagnes, namely the slogan Creating jobs for americans.	2
because they are trying to get americans to vote for them	2
this slogan is also prominent in ads made by private corporations	2
As if creating jobs for americans is morally superior to creating jobs for people of other countries.	2
The companies launching these ads may be trying to win in the american market, so they can sell more of their product,	2
the fact that this can increase sales shows that many americans hold the being born on one side of a line belief	2
they are merely trying to win votes or make money from this mentality	2
I would define patriotism quite simply as supporting one's country, but not *necessarily* disparaging others.	2
Someone who attempts to extract gain for themselves at harm to their overall country is acting unpatriotically	2
someone who assists another country that is in worse shape instead of assisting their own can still be a patriot, but also recognize significant need in other nations and decide to assist them as well	2
especially when you live in a country as large as the U.S. most acts which serve the common good generally support your country	2
CMV:Patriotism is the belief that being born on one side of a line makes you better.	1
American patriots have a general mentality against immigration.	1
I understand why politics use this slogan	1
I am not blaming the politicians or corporations running ads running these slogans	1
really it is the citizens that have the belief that they are better, because of the side of a line they are born on, that are at fault	1
Patriotism is really just this belief.	1
Therefore I would say that the antithesis of patriotism is not having a global perspective, but is in fact selfishness	1
Whether you support immigration or not, so long as you are supporting what you believe is best for your nation, you are still acting patriotically	1
even if you decide to support another nation you can still be acting patriotically as well so long as you support your nation too	1
This is true	1
I think, supporting the common good is also more important than supporting your country	1
Yes	1
the two are often one the same	1

you don't have to necessarily think you're better than other people because you're against immigration	2

Because of the anonymity on 4chan people are more prone to not think through, care about what they post and are quicker to throw out insults.	2

since it's largely negative they will stoop down to the same level rather than go to any high ground since they are not linked to an identity	2
Surrounding the entire site there's a general pessimistic group mentality	2
people are subconsciously encouraged to take part of it in order to feel like they are a part of the group	2
Some boards will have specific groups of people who they are encouraged to hate, women, SJWs, casual gamers, Jews	2
any reasonable argument against a poster can be made redundant by saying or thinking they are a part of these agendas or groups	2

Things about e-celebrities will start as rumors	2
ideas about them or things will get taken out of context and it will be posted continually until it's taken as fact	2
It will reach conspiracy theory levels of "proof" where people will simply believe it because they feel as if they are a part of a group-effort that's uncovering something.	2
Some people aren't changed by others that easily.	2

a little girl was swept by a car in Paris	2
she was lying unconscious with a bit of blood from her nose	2
people were hysterical	2
I kept the mother in check cause she was trying to move her	2
then had to keep the people around in check cause they were physically trying to restrain her to prevent the mother to only touch her	2
she was getting totally mad	2
All while calling the ER and taking a picture of the car's licence plate cause the driver kept near his open door all the time (while he was being harassed and yelled at by like 10 persons)	2
Just 2 weeks ago, heard and felt a crash very close to my house	2
a drunken teen had just smashed his car full force into another's property wall after missing the turn	2
neighbors went out but no one had the head to keep the guy in check, cause he was walking near his ruined car, not understanding what just happened told him to stay put and sit and just generally speak to him so he doesn't freak out	2
People were looking from a few meters, not doing anything	2
I called the ER	2
the guy stood up and tried to restart his car	2
had to take his keys from him, spent 20 minutes, making small talk, reassuring him and just generally checking if he wasn't internally hurt/losing consciousness/ had blood coming out from the mouth ears or nose	2
He seemed ok appart from the shock and high level drunkenness.	2

People were looking from a few meters, not doing anything.	0
I called the ER, the guy stood up and tried to restart his car, had to take his keys from him, spent 20 minutes, making small talk, reassuring him and just generally checking if he wasn't internally hurt/losing consciousness/ had blood coming out from the mouth ears or nose.	0
He seemed ok appart from the shock and high level drunkenness.	0
Aaand... I work in a surgery unit and the kind of gore I witness there doesn't shock me at all .	0
So yeah. It wasn't a person cut in half or whatever gore you can see on 4chan but I think a bit of desensitization can help keep a leveled head in stressful situations.	0

I point out that many Christians follow the bible which has numerous examples of sexism, but in application, there are numerous branches of Christianity that are no more sexist than secular groups.	1
my belief is that while religion can inform the views of people, it is far more likely that religion will be used to justify actions that would have been executed any way.	1
I think that most Jewish people don't want to stone adulterers and most Muslims don't want to stone non believers.	1
Your stance relies on the assumption that religion has no influence on the actions of its followers beyond the superficial.	1
With this in mind, I think its safe to assume the truth is somewhere in between, with both the religion and the culture somehow influencing the unrest we see.	1
it obviously does	1

e.g. how much of the violence perpetrated by Wahabist Islamists is based off of true religious fanaticism	2
how much is caused by angry, politically disenfranchised young men who seek out an ideology that justifies their anger with America/the West	2
Vikings believed that the highest achievement and best place in the afterlife were gained by dying bravely in battle.	2
The Thuggee cult believed that the murder of innocents was necessary to appease Kali and prevent the destruction of the world.	2
Aztecs required human sacrifice in their religious rituals.	2
Perhaps some facets of these historical religions were based off of a desire to justify actions that the original practitioners would have done anyway	2
the belief eventually becomes the driving force and incentive for the action in later generations.	2
Many religions have historically encouraged, or even required violence, and once that religion and it's expectation of violence is established, it makes it much more difficult to enact societal change on the group.	2
It's hard enough to change a social norm of violence when it's simply cultural, it's even harder if people have been conditioned to believe that the norm is all that stands in the way of preventing the end of the world or is a persons only way into Valhalla.	2

therefore passed down by parents	2
For example, we could use the IQ scale (for want of a better intelligence measure) to determine the number of offspring a person should be able to genetically contribute to.	2
Like, round the IQ to the nearest multiple of 50, then divide by 50, and that's the number of offspring you're allowed to create.	2
So someone with near average intelligence (near 100 IQ, 75-124) would have their IQ rounded to 100 and then divided by 50 to make 2 offspring.	2
The total offspring is presumably equal to the number of people who contributed to it.	2
A man and a woman with average IQ can have two children (not each.) and sustain their population.	2
Conversely, really above average IQs of 125-174 can contribute genetically towards 3 children... and so on.	2
therefore more likely to survive and advance the human race.	2
I know this would be a bitch to implement and it's near impossible to actually do	2
I know the IQ test has its faults and every policy can be abused	2
If a mother can make 2, and has twins, she can't make more, but if she already has one and has twins after one which makes 3, we're not gonna kill one	2
Perhaps if you have a major, heritable health issue your IQ has 25 subtracted from it before being rounded?	2
maybe weighted differently, like extremely high chance of cancer (almost 100 percent or something) takes off more... Something like that.	2
Much better than "Kill off those with IQ less than 80"	2

Intelligence is hard to define and describe even by neurologists	2
reducing that complexity down to one number is incredibly challenging if not impossible	2
More intelligent people tend to have less children than do the more uneducated.	2
There are multiple reasons for this, more intelligent people tend to be more busy with careers, etc.	2
This means that even if we went really extreme and killed everyone with an IQ under 80.....that would change nothing.	2
The average IQ will still be measured in the same way	2
the lowest scores will be assigned the lower numbers and the average will be the same	2
"for want of better measure of intelligence"	2
I would love a better measure of intelligence.	2
Some theorize that intelligence can be defined in categories, too...(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences)	2
Like a total of all of them.	2
In a perfect world, sure.	2
my theory limits the offspring of less-intelligent people	2
Less intelligent- less babies than contributors- less "less intelligent people" (and that would always be the case...)	2
I only used the IQ test in my example because so far it is (seemingly) the most available measure of intelligence	2
better than SAT scores, right?	2
instead of killing lower than 80, it would be killing lower than like 50 or whatever	2
The "number of mental retardation" would be adjusted from lower than 70 to whatever it would be, too,	2
In total, everyone's IQ would be x points higher and so the human race would be x much smarter...	2
A brilliant mathematician make suck in all other areas such as music ability, linguistic skills, etc. making them look like a retard compared to a guy who is okay at math but also descent in those other categories.	2
It is a complex ploygenic trait we still don't fully understand.	2
it isn't really feasible to control the populations genitals in any ethical manner.	2
I know it sucks but I have nothing better does not justify using a sucky measurement.	2
If we valued and weighted the categorical intelligences... Perhaps a brilliant mathematician would end up being (weighted) almost equal to a well rounded guy.	2
Pass down mathy skills of father and kinesthetic skills of mother or whatever	2
Eh, maybe we don't fully understand it, but we know that through breeding we can increase it, right?	2
Just because we don't understand every minute aspect of it doesn't mean we can't recognize what parts are positive and how to increase it.	2
Well hopefully it wouldn't be implemented in a way that forces you to do anything except stop having children after you reached the point where any more and you'd be hurting future generation's intelligence.	2
I used it as an example of an intelligence measure	2
I meant most available as the "most available/recognizable example of intelligence"	2
Since we do not know the one to one correlations between a complex variety of genes and gene interactions and the vaguely defined intelligence that they produce you cannot feasibly do this.	2
What if someone with a low intellect (however the hell you measure it) and high intellect want to breed?	2
Also, only one of my parents finished high school.	2
I am their 6th child.	2
I have a Masters degree.	2
See my user history for reference	2
We don't know all of the complex genetic and environmental elements that go into intellect to do anything remotely like what you are describing.	2
The "Yeah but what if..." thing just isn't going to fly.	2
It is not conducive to a productive conversation of this sort.	2
Well if someone of low intellect wanted to breed with someone of high intellect, their children count would be limited by the lower children count.	2
Later in life, if higher intellect person wants more children, they can, only if they don't have a genetic contributor from someone who already fulfilled their amount?	2
which kind of is, meaning degrees kind of are	2
We don't know all	2
we know some	2
Maybe the hypothetical game is annoying and not productive, but its not intellectually dishonest...	2
I'm sorry, maybe I shouldn't have posted this topic.	2
Which is basically like saying if unicorns were real, they would be real.	2
CMV: Eugenics isn't all that bad... And we don't even have to kill anyone for it	1
Intelligence is at least partially genetic	1
I'm against killing.	1
This would eventually make the human race smarter	1
Exceptions would be made when you accidentally have twins which causes you to go over your limit	1
IQ is not considered to be a good or accurate measure of overall intellect	1
It may also be important to note that your system isn't only difficult to implement like you point out, it's also in direct conflict with how things actually work.	1
Lastly you must recognize that the IQ test is a standardized test.	1
I mentioned that	1
I'm not proposing we implement it	1
I completely understand your distaste with the IQ test.	1
And when the IQ test is adjusted, we would adjust the cutoff rate for "da murder" if we were to take that route in the first place.	1
I don't see your point there	1
My route would be a slower, more ethical way to do it.	1
Separating intelligence into categories *is* a far better way to go about it	1
by it's very nature implies you cannot sum them	1
The point is intelligence is too complicated for us to try to breed certain kinds of it.	1
It is also downright silly to consider	1
This is not a good reason to use anything.	1
Perhaps, but if we summed it, future generations would be on average smarter than past ones.	1
if we learn more about genetics and genetic engineering we would be able to selectively breed intelligence	1
You misinterpreted	1
I wouldn't advocate using the actual IQ scale as the starting measure of doing this at all	1
I do not want our current IQ scale to be used in any way even close to this.	1
I think you are still oversimplifying it.	1
no you can't just increase intelligence through controlling the breeding rights of the population	1
I, like some of the other commentators here, find the hypothetical game to be intellectually dishonest.	1
I think you could increase intelligence through controlling the breeding rights of a population.	1
I don't think its feasible, though...	1
degrees are no more a measure of intelligence than IQ	1
which should be enough to increase intelligence	1
I posted with the actual intent of proving that a hypothetical situation could have eugenics be good.	1
Eugenics is not realistically feasible	1
But in a hypothetical world where it is feasible, it would be a good thing	1
Eugenics would work if eugenics worked.	1
No	1
I think you'll find someone who has a degree in topic X is a much better indicator of their holistic intellectual ability with respect to category X than a simple reductive IQ test.	1
Yes and yes and sorry :/	1

A man and a woman with average IQ can have two children (not each.) and sustain their population.	0
Conversely, really above average IQs of 125-174 can contribute genetically towards 3 children... and so on.	0
This would eventually make the human race smarter, and therefore more likely to survive and advance the human race.	0
I know this would be a bitch to implement and it's near impossible to actually do, but I'm just looking at the concept.	0
I know the IQ test has its faults and every policy can be abused... I know all that.	0
Exceptions would be made when you accidentally have twins which causes you to go over your limit, or etc.	0
(If a mother can make 2, and has twins, she can't make more, but if she already has one and has twins after one which makes 3, we're not gonna kill one)	0
Perhaps if you have a major, heritable health issue your IQ has 25 subtracted from it before being rounded?	0
Or maybe weighted differently, like extremely high chance of cancer (almost 100 percent or something) takes off more... Something like that.	0
Much better than "Kill off those with IQ less than 80"	0
I wouldn't mind a smarter human race...	0
EDIT: **I am trying to argue that this process, if not abused, if followed by the people, and if we found an increasingly accurate measure of intelligence, would be ultimately a good thing to advance the human race.**	0
EDIT 2: "**It looks to me like you've made so many exceptions to your main view that you aren't looking to have your view changed. I'd like to talk about the title of your post, but if you have to make so many exceptions to your view, then it seems you already know it's incorrect.**" -nikeson	0
I suppose that's true, now....	0
Firstly, IQ is not considered to be a good or accurate measure of overall intellect.	0
Intelligence is hard to define and describe even by neurologists and reducing that complexity down to one number is incredibly challenging if not impossible.	0
It may also be important to note that your system isn't only difficult to implement like you point out, it's also in direct conflict with how things actually work.	0
More intelligent people tend to have less children than do the more uneducated.	0
There are multiple reasons for this, more intelligent people tend to be more busy with careers, etc.	0
Lastly you must recognize that the IQ test is a standardized test.	0
This means that even if we went really extreme and killed everyone with an IQ under 80.....that would change nothing.	0
The average IQ will still be measured in the same way, the lowest scores will be assigned the lower numbers and the average will be the same.	0
Firstly, I mentioned that.	0
("for want of better measure of intelligence")	0
I would love a better measure of intelligence.	0
[Some theorize that intelligence can be defined in categories, too...(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences)	0
So, maybe a complex way to combine them.	0
Like a total of all of them.	0
Idc.	0
I know about number two...	0
I'm not proposing we implement it.	0
In a perfect world, sure.	0
But at least my theory limits the offspring of less-intelligent people.	0
Less intelligent- less babies than contributors- less "less intelligent people" (and that would always be the case...)	0
I completely understand your distaste with the IQ test.	0
Again, I only used the IQ test in my example because so far it is (seemingly) the most available measure of intelligence.	0
(better than SAT scores, right?)	0
And when the IQ test is adjusted, we would adjust the cutoff rate for "da murder" if we were to take that route in the first place.	0
(instead of killing lower than 80, it would be killing lower than like 50 or whatever)	0
The "number of mental retardation" would be adjusted from lower than 70 to whatever it would be, too, so I don't see your point there.	0
In total, everyone's IQ would be x points higher and so the human race would be x much smarter...	0
My route would be a slower, more ethical way to do it.	0
Separating intelligence into categories *is* a far better way to go about it, but by it's very nature implies you cannot sum them.	0
A brilliant mathematician make suck in all other areas such as music ability, linguistic skills, etc. making them look like a retard compared to a guy who is okay at math but also descent in those other categories.	0
The point is intelligence is too complicated for us to try to breed certain kinds of it.	0
It is a complex ploygenic trait we still don't fully understand.	0
It is also downright silly to consider since, as we know it isn't really feasible to control the populations genitals in any ethical manner.	0
> I only used the IQ test in my example because so far it is (seemingly) the most available measure of intelligence	0
This is not a good reason to use anything. I know it sucks but I have nothing better does not justify using a sucky measurement.	0
1.	0
Perhaps, but if we summed it, future generations would be on average smarter than past ones.	0
If we valued and weighted the categorical intelligences... Perhaps a brilliant mathematician would end up being (weighted) almost equal to a well rounded guy.	0
I also would like to add, hopefully if we learn more about genetics and genetic engineering we would be able to selectively breed intelligence (Pass down mathy skills of father and kinesthetic skills of mother or whatever)	0
> (The point is intelligence is too complicated for us to try to breed certain kinds of it. It is a complex ploygenic trait we still don't fully understand.)	0
Eh, maybe we don't fully understand it, but we know that through breeding we can increase it, right?	0
Just because we don't understand every minute aspect of it doesn't mean we can't recognize what parts are positive and how to increase it.	0
Well hopefully it wouldn't be implemented in a way that forces you to do anything except stop having children after you reached the point where any more and you'd be hurting future generation's intelligence.	0
Let me clarify! You misinterpreted, I wouldn't advocate using the actual IQ scale as the starting measure of doing this at all, I used it as an example of an intelligence measure, and I meant most available as the "most available/recognizable example of intelligence"	0
I do not want our current IQ scale to be used in any way even close to this.	0
I think you are still oversimplifying it.	0
And no you can't just increase intelligence through controlling the breeding rights of the population.	0
Since we do not know the one to one correlations between a complex variety of genes and gene interactions and the vaguely defined intelligence that they produce you cannot feasibly do this.	0
What if someone with a low intellect (however the hell you measure it) and high intellect want to breed?	0
Also, only one of my parents finished high school.	0
I am their 6th child.	0
I have a Masters degree.	0
(See my user history for reference).	0
We don't know all of the complex genetic and environmental elements that go into intellect to do anything remotely like what you are describing.	0
> I also would like to add, hopefully if we learn more about genetics and genetic engineering we would be able to selectively breed intelligence	0
I, like some of the other commentators here, find the hypothetical game to be intellectually dishonest.	0
The "Yeah but what if..." thing just isn't going to fly.	0
It is not conducive to a productive conversation of this sort.	0
Well if someone of low intellect wanted to breed with someone of high intellect, their children count would be limited by the lower children count.	0
Later in life, if higher intellect person wants more children, they can, only if they don't have a genetic contributor from someone who already fulfilled their amount?	0
I think you could increase intelligence through controlling the breeding rights of a population.	0
I don't think its feasible, though...	0
Congrats on your degree, but degrees are no more a measure of intelligence than IQ (which kind of is, meaning degrees kind of are)	0
We don't know all, true, but we know some, which should be enough to increase intelligence.	0
Maybe the hypothetical game is annoying and not productive, but its not intellectually dishonest...	0
I'm sorry, maybe I shouldn't have posted this topic.	0
I posted with the actual intent of proving that a hypothetical situation could have eugenics be good.	0
*shrug* in the end, are we agreeing that	0
1. Eugenics is not realistically feasible	0
2.	0
But in a hypothetical world where it is feasible, it would be a good thing	0
?	0
Eugenics would work if eugenics worked.	0
That's basically all you've said.	0
Which is basically like saying if unicorns were real, they would be real.	0
> Congrats on your degree, but degrees are no more a measure of intelligence than IQ (which kind of is, meaning degrees kind of are)	0
No	0
. I think you'll find someone who has a degree in topic X is a much better indicator of their holistic intellectual ability with respect to category X than a simple reductive IQ test.	0
Yes and yes and sorry :/	0
	0
Edit: My view was changed when Namemedickles pointed out how basically my argument depended on changing everything about how something could be implemented to the point of where it is impossible	0
>Eugenics would work if eugenics worked. That's basically all you've said.	0
there is no afterlife	2
we die	2
Living life is as irrational as reading a book that, after finished, is immediately erased from your memory	2
It is comparable to that, too	2

You didn't exist	2

When I die, I return to this state after a brief period of consciousness	2
I return to it permanently	2
I might as well have never lived	2
They will die too	2
And then their descendants will die, on and on and on	2
eventually the universe is destroyed or our galaxy collapses in an inevitable heat-death	2
Even if 1,000,000 people were helped by me	2
assuming they all die	2
For I will be dead and won't know what I did	2
once they die, they won't know either	2
I'll be dead, and again, death is nothingness	2
Thus, I won't be around to enjoy my fame	2
once I die, all memories and all point is gone	2
If existence (from your perspective) lies solely on your consciousness	2
it no longer exists since you cannot experience it.	2
In a metaphysical sense you could argue that we essentially never exist.	2
death is an elimination of existence	2
you can free yourself from society's many irrational norms and expectations.	2
May as well enjoy life while you temporarily exist.	2
you just never have the conscious mind to experience the fear of contemplating it.	2

In a metaphysical sense you could argue that we essentially never exist.	0
This of course is assuming that death is an elimination of existence which is beyond what anybody truly knows.	0
It is a bit depressing but can also be quite liberating as you can free yourself from society's many irrational norms and expectations.	0
As for things having meaning, from this standpoint you can create your own meaning.	0

I used to follow 'option number 3', but recently started 'option number 1' in an attempt to line my actions up with my values.	2
I know, for instance, that components in my smartphone and laptop are made of minerals that were mined by slave labor in Africa.	2
I know that the chocolates I love to eat contain, in all likelihood, cacao that was farmed by people living in truly deplorable conditions.	2
I know that the medication I take was almost certainly tested on research animals who lived short, sad lives.	2
I know that there's a good chance that the shirt I'm wearing was produced by underpaid, overworked labors who might have even been children.	2
I know that the salad I'm planning to eat for lunch contains ingredients that were probably farmed in environmentally destructive ways that contribute to climate change.	2
I know that my leftover Christmas cookies, made by my vegetarian mother, still contain eggs that probably came from a battery farm.	2
I know that by purchasing my knockoff Keurig coffee from Wal-Mart, I'm supporting a corporation that exploits everything it touches.	2
It's easier to forget and ignore because there's too much injustice in the world if you tally it all up.	2
This would also be my reasoning if I were vegan but still wouldn't take a flight out to help build a school in Africa.	2
It would also make sense if I was building a school in African but wasn't vegan.	2
So while someone might take Option 1 on a personally significant issue that has a lot of meaning to them, the limitations of the human mind force them to take Option 3 on a whole lot of other issues.	2
Without prioritizing those resources, there's a risk of "compassion fatigue,"	2
which you see frequently among people in empathy-intensive occupations (especially medicine, education, and other fields where issues outside the individual's control tend to produce strong feelings of frustration and futility).	2
I do care about the welfare of food animals	2
I do think that there are ways to produce meat in ways that are at least more humane if not more "ethical."	2
I support these efforts when they're available.	2
But I also think that the welfare of food animals is part of a much larger constellation of interrelated "food production issues" that involve everything from environmental impacts to worker safety to the corporatization of agriculture to government subsidies	2
without some major changes to those other "food production issues" then there probably won't be significant improvement in animal welfare.	2
CMV: I believe you have three choices once you discover the suffering animals endure in the meat industry...	1
The options are as follows	1
1. You don't agree with what is going on and stop supporting it.	1
2. You don't care about animals, so you're content with paying for them to be abused for your pleasure.	1
3. You don't agree with what is going on, but try to put it to the back of your mind and continue to support it.	1
I suspect this way of looking at it is still somewhat simplistic however	1
I think restricting this concept to the meat industry limits us to a "vegetarian/vegan lifestyle vs. carnivore lifestyle" debate	1
it's actually a lot deeper than that.	1
A completely ethical lifestyle is probably not possible without completely rejecting the modern world.	1
I have to accept that I will *never* be able to fully live within my own values.	1
I see what you're getting at.	1
I'd still consider what you described as being the third option on my original post	1
it's a very detailed version of it that explains it well.	1
If I was doing absolutely nothing to aid any of the values I believe in, then it wouldn't make any sense however.	1
Yeah	1
I think there's just a limited number of things that people are capable of caring about at one time	1
issues that are of personal relevance are always going to carry more weight.	1
So somebody who takes Option 3 on a particular issue may not be making a true choice to *ignore* that issue.	1
They're just prioritizing their mental resources.	1
it's good that people have different Option 1 priorities to attack the problems from multiple sides.	1
whilst my original view still stands	1
you've altered it in such a way that I now feel a little able to understand others better and in a less scornful light at least!	1

There have been 55 million abortions in the US since 1973	2
Something in the ballpark of 45% of women who have abortions have more than one abortion	2
Waging war to purposefully lower population, even with a country facing similar issues, would cost not only resources, but it would also cause political, cultural, and global issues	2
America's innovation and education rankings would be lower	2
Every middle-class child in the country would receive a lower quality education if there were 55 million more around	2
Without the extra population from abortions, has there been proportionately more immigration to fill labor needs, or are the millions of illegals from Mexico as likely to be so numerous even if there was a higher none-abortion population	2
Doesn't immigration of a working class citizen on such a massive scale cause dissonance in a country more so than it does cultural exchange	2
Or are we talking about a population so huge that race and national identity are insignificant, that there is always going to be a huge amount of hostility between different demographics	2
surely its a significant number	2
how many of these women wouldn't be having financial troubles if there wasn't competition from cheap illegal labor to keep wages lower	2
An aborted fetus is likely to have been a less productive person than a never-considered-for-abortion fetus	2
http://www.guttmacher.org/media/nr/2010/05/04/index.html	2
most poor children don't become prisoners	2
most poor children don't become unemployed for the majority of their life	2
most prisoners only spend a fraction of their lives in prison - most of their life is free	2
many mothers who had abortions decided to have children later in their life	2
if they had not aborted their earlier pregnancies, then many of them would not have made that decision	2
had those abortions never occurred, then America's immigration policies would not have been so lax	2
there would be less need for unskilled labor, leading to less unskilled immigrants in exchange for more unskilled natives (all of whom would be tax-paying citizens, unlike all immigrants)	2
if abortions were not permitted, then people would be less likely to have unprotected sex out of fear of forced pregnancies	2
CMV: America is a better place because of the 55 million abortions its had	1
These people would have been raised by their incompetent parents to drain down society, increase crime rates, suck up resources, and generally screw things up	1
Various ways to lower a resource negative population would have to be explored, if not because of this 55 million, then because of the next 55 million	1
One possibility is that there would be wars waged to try to kill them all, perhaps even with other countries with similar problems	1
Its a complicated issue	1
it would have been preferable to have our abortions alive	1
Perhaps the immigration of illegals is lowering the value of blue collar work and makes it harder for the borderline impoverished citizens to provide for their children	1
Its debatable how many women are having abortions due to financial reasons	1
This holds true even if illegal immigration is an overall plus to the countries value	1

The only way your argument holds is if an extremely high percentage of these potential kids would have been unproductive members of society (if they were criminals, sucked up resources, drained society, etc)	1
Let's say an unproductive member of society is one who spends a large portion of their life in prison and/or unemployed.	1
It might be true that 42% of the aborted babies would have been [below the federal poverty line]	1
This implies that the vast majority of time spent by the aborted babies would have been spent *not* in an unproductive manner (i.e. not imprisoned or unemployed)	1
the aborted babies would have contributed more than they sucked up	1
your argument assumes that if those abortions never happened then we would have 55 million more people in the country.	1
I think is flawed	1
if abortions never happened, we would have more people, but not 55 million more	1

CMV: America is a better place because of the 55 million abortions its had	0
http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rd7mg/cmv_america_is_a_better_place_because_of_the_55/	0
There have been 55 million abortions in the US since 1973.	0
Something in the ballpark of 45% of women who have abortions have more than one abortion.	0
These people would have been raised by their incompetent parents to drain down society, increase crime rates, suck up resources, and generally screw things up.	0
Various ways to lower a resource negative population would have to be explored, if not because of this 55 million, then because of the next 55 million.	0
One possibility is that there would be wars waged to try to kill them all, perhaps even with other countries with similar problems.	0
Waging war to purposefully lower population, even with a country facing similar issues, would cost not only resources, but it would also cause political, cultural, and global issues.	0
America's innovation and education rankings would be lower.	0
Every middle-class child in the country would receive a lower quality education if there were 55 million more around.	0
(**Note:**I'm not trying to hear arguments on the ethics of abortion, its a banal argument that everyone and their mother has had at one point, what I am really fishing for is insight into what the country would look like with those 55 million around.	0
Would we adapt to the population and make good use of each of them?)	0
**Was view changed?**	0
Its a complicated issue.	0
Without the extra population from abortions, has there been proportionately more immigration to fill labor needs, or are the millions of illegals from Mexico as likely to be so numerous even if there was a higher none-abortion population?	0
Doesn't immigration of a working class citizen on such a massive scale cause dissonance in a country more so than it does cultural exchange, meaning that it would have been preferable to have our abortions alive?	0
Or are we talking about a population so huge that race and national identity are insignificant, that there is always going to be a huge amount of hostility between different demographics?	0
-(choppy writing, but i'm on 3 hours of sleep and stretched for time, give me a break)-	0
(Side thought: Perhaps the immigration of illegals is lowering the value of blue collar work and makes it harder for the borderline impoverished citizens to provide for their children.	0
Its debatable how many women are having abortions due to financial reasons, but surely its a significant number, so how many of these women wouldn't be having financial troubles if there wasn't competition from cheap illegal labor to keep wages lower?	0
This holds true even if illegal immigration is an overall plus to the countries value.	0
Conclusion: Mexicans are the supreme race, native Americans will go extinct through abortion and then out-breeding. *no that isn't a serious sentiment,	0
i'm just saying, this discussion is abstract enough to go into some weird places and that it is necessary to have a stopping point* )	0
Then there is the next question.	0
Is a more highly populated and economically productive America today going to result in an America tomorrow that can handle over population problems, or would having a higher population from none-abortion just add on to the problems of a world going to shit?	0
Similar: An aborted fetus is likely to have been a less productive person than a never-considered-for-abortion fetus, but in an industrial society, its likely that these abortions would still be more productive than not.	0
Then there was the debate as to whether or not a larger population with less resources per person is more innovative than a smaller one.	0
This is to be considered if one is convinced that having a higher population coming from none-abortions results in a strain for resources in the country.	0
Modern technology like the internet must be considered.	0
Yes, my view was changed, but not into the polar opposite.	0
I am now confused and lost.	0
**EDIT:**	0
I'll be without internet for a few days.	0

This was my first post to CMV.	0
I apologize for a few things that I did that could be considered *rude* around here.	0
I also see a few times where I got redundant.	0
Thank you all for your arguments.	0
This is a very critical place, I hope to learn how to better use it and come here more often.	0
I feel I could learn a lot here.	0
The only way your argument holds is if an extremely high percentage of these potential kids would have been unproductive members of society (if they were criminals, sucked up resources, drained society, etc).	0
Let's say an unproductive member of society is one who spends a large portion of their life in prison and/or unemployed.	0
It might be true that 42% of the aborted babies would have been [below the federal poverty line](http://www.guttmacher.org/media/nr/2010/05/04/index.html) ; but (a) most poor children don't become prisoners, (b) most poor children don't become unemployed for the majority of their life, and (c) most prisoners only spend a fraction of their lives in prison - most of their life is free.	0
This implies that the vast majority of time spent by the aborted babies would have been spent *not* in an unproductive manner (i.e. not imprisoned or unemployed).	0
Therefore, the aborted babies would have contributed more than they sucked up.	0
Furthermore, your argument assumes that if those abortions never happened then we would have 55 million more people in the country.	0
I think is flawed for a few reasons.	0
Firstly, many mothers who had abortions decided to have children later in their life.	0
But if they had not aborted their earlier pregnancies, then many of them would not have made that decision.	0
Secondly, had those abortions never occurred, then America's immigration policies would not have been so lax as there would be less need for unskilled labor, leading to less unskilled immigrants in exchange for more unskilled natives (all of whom would be tax-paying citizens, unlike all immigrants).	0
And lastly, if abortions were not permitted, then people would be less likely to have unprotected sex out of fear of forced pregnancies.	0
Therefore, if abortions never happened, we would have more people, but not 55 million more.	0

Therefore, there will always be a market for meat and other animal products	2
Since the majority of farms are large factory farms	2
this practice would be much easier to "evangelize" than a vegetarian or vegan diet.	2
Face it, meat is tasty (and non-factory meat is often tastier than factory-farmed meat, at least in my own anecdotal experience)	2
Making a political statement is not the same as organizing a boycott.	2
Vegans live the way they do because they feel a certain way about the way we exploit animals.	2
I think you are misinterpreting their motives.	2
I don't believe in donating to the Salvation Army, for example, because there have been incidents in the past where their organization has denied aid to homosexuals and publicly expressed homophobic views.	2
I do NOT believe that my actions will bring about the demise of the Salvation Army, or really have any effect at all.	2
That is not my motive.	2
I know several of them (I understand that anecdotal evidence is not the best kind of evidence but there you have it).	2
That makes zero sense.	2
Even if they think that being vegan is a way to directly improve conditions for animals, I don't think they believe it's the *best* way.	2
CMV: Veganism and vegetarianism are not the best way to improve farm animal welfare	1
The chances of the entire world adopting a vegan/vegetarian diet are slim to none	1
The food market, like all other markets, operates on general principles of supply and demand	1
Meat farmers can use techniques exhibiting a range of costs or benefits, both in terms of environmental impact and animal welfare.	1
A vegan or vegetarian diet denies demand, and thus potential revenue, to all meat-producing farms, regardless of how humane or environmentally sound their practice are.	1
I concede that this is probably good for animal welfare.	1
Purchasing meat from farms known to produce their meat in an ethical way not only denies demand to large factory farms	1
helps improve the market share of ethical meat-growing	1
which seems as though it would be even better for animal welfare.	1
My general view is that people should probably as a rule eat less meat from better growers	1
that will make for a bigger shift in growing practices than simply people dropping out of eating meat altogether.	1
I strongly, strongly doubt they believe that in doing so, they are making great strides in improving conditions for animals.	1
I think the vast majority of vegans and vegetarians are not delusional and feel similarly about the meat industry as I do about the Salvation Army.	1
I totally agree,	1
There are.	1
if you've met people like that, they're wrong, simple as that.	1
But I strongly doubt there are people who actually think, "not eating meat is *definitely* the BEST THING I can do for animal welfare!"	1
That plus the fact that a large portion of the vegan advocacy I've seen revolves around the horrors of factory farming which, I believe, would be far more effectively reduced by responsible carnivory than by veganism.	1

Yes but your stated view is "veganism and vegetarianism are not the best way to improve farm animal welfare," as if there are real people that actually think that.	0
There are.	0
I know several of them (I understand that anecdotal evidence is not the best kind of evidence but there you have it).	0
Are you sure?	0
I mean, if you've met people like that, they're wrong, simple as that.	0
And they don't represent the majority of vegans, that's for sure.	0

Even if they think that being vegan is a way to directly improve conditions for animals, I don't think they believe it's the *best* way.	0
Sorry but I think this is a strawman argument.	0
It's good to know that this view doesn't make up the majority of vegans.	0
The vegans who believe the way I've described and who made up a good chunk of the vegans I've encountered, were a large part of my inspiration to write this CMV.	0
That plus the fact that a large portion of the vegan advocacy I've seen revolves around the horrors of factory farming which, I believe, would be far more effectively reduced by responsible carnivory than by veganism.	0

According to the theory of evolution it makes more sense that the egg preceded the chicken	2
Before the chicken there was a similar but different creature.	2
Let's call it X.	2
Its completely arbitrary when the X officially evolved into a chicken	2
at some point it does	2
An X, not a chicken lays the first chicken egg.	2
There is no sharp line representing a single generation that became chickens.	2
The newly defined chicken species (a species is hard enough to define as it is) is not recognized as a new species of chickens until you already have an independently reproducing population.	2
there were ancestral species that produced eggs,	2
the dividing line between species is quite arbitrary	2
Species are labeled by humans, but really we are all similar life.	2
An independently reproductive community of animals should only be defined as such once their chicken babies are layed or hatched.	2
CMV The EGG came first before the chicken.	1
The chicken egg comes before any creature considered a chicken exist.	1
In terms of evolution, the question is erroneous.	1
The ancestral organism from which the chicken is derived never gave bith to a chicken egg.	1
due to the gradual process that produces what we call new species and how we define them, there was never a single egg that gave rise to the first chicken.	1
if scientists had enough evidence a distinction would be made.	1
Where ever the distinction would be made, wouldn't that make the egg first?	1
And if you define a species as an independently reproducing population I think both comes at the same time.	1
When that happens the egg becomes a chicken egg and the X becomes a chicken.	1

Saying these people shouldnt be allowed to become part of the country, is the same as saying they are worse,	2
because they were born on a different side of a line	2
americans are better because of the side of the line they are born on	2
This is prominent in many ads and political champagnes, namely the slogan Creating jobs for americans.	2
because they are trying to get americans to vote for them	2
this slogan is also prominent in ads made by private corporations	2
As if creating jobs for americans is morally superior to creating jobs for people of other countries.	2
The companies launching these ads may be trying to win in the american market, so they can sell more of their product,	2
the fact that this can increase sales shows that many americans hold the being born on one side of a line belief	2
they are merely trying to win votes or make money from this mentality	2
According to George Orwell, Nationalism is the "worst enemy of peace".	2
According to him, nationalism is the thought of superiority of one's nation in direct comparison to foreign nations,	2
patriotism is simply the love and admiration of one's own country, independent of other countries.	2
Nationalism is the one that says "America is the best, most perfect country in the world, unlike those other horrible, dirty, evil foreign countries.	2
Americans are the shining example of civil people in the world and everyone else is filthy and brutish and doesn't deserve entry here".	2
Patriotism simply says "America is a good country. its not the best, and it might be better or worse than other countries, but i still love and respect it".	2
they have the belief that they are American	2
would prefer their country over other countries, regardless of who's better	2
even if countries are peaceful and cooperative towards each other,	2
they are still in competition and no matter what, they are still separate and independent.	2
in a competition, you don't provide for the opposite side.	2
It is simply not our place or responsibility to carry other countries' burdens.	2
And these slogans don't even denote any sense of superiority over a foreign country, just a preference for your own country.	2
if an advertisement was "creating jobs for Americans and not for those dirty foreign leeches",	2
THAT would be claiming superiority over foreigners.	2

Surrounding the entire site there's a general pessimistic group mentality	2
people are subconsciously encouraged to take part of it in order to feel like they are a part of the group	2
Some boards will have specific groups of people who they are encouraged to hate, women, SJWs, casual gamers, Jews	2
any reasonable argument against a poster can be made redundant by saying or thinking they are a part of these agendas or groups	2
On boards you will find echo chambers where people are more prone to believe rumors than proof	2
Things about e-celebrities will start as rumors	2
ideas about them or things will get taken out of context and it will be posted continually until it's taken as fact	2
It will reach conspiracy theory levels of "proof" where people will simply believe it because they feel as if they are a part of a group-effort that's uncovering something.	2
that phenomenon has been around forever	2
(Tumblr's community is heavily guilty of this same thing).	2

I've honestly seen more positive activism stem from the anonymity culture than I have from any other site.	2
equate the anonymity as some cheap way for them to be hateful under the guise of free speech,	2
that couldn't really be further from the truth.	2
So why would a bunch of social outcasts who get made fun of encourage hate and let such raw emotion reign supreme?	2
Getting called a *faggot* on 4chan constantly helps you to brush it off when you hear it on the street,	2
the nice thing about the anonymity of the 4chan board is essentially you have a new identity with each post letting you brush it off even more.	2
That last post you made someone made fun of you, well cool no one knows that the person who just made the post people are laughing at was the same post they were making fun of.	2
You're no longer the *faggot* you're the *comedian* until you make a new post and you're the *troll*.	2
quite honestly it's nice to be able to show raw emotion and not have it permanently tied to your identity.	2
You never have to worry about people being like "oh that dude, that dude always has problems -ignored-"	2
I've used 4chan a bunch of times to let out my problems about being depressed, suicidal and raped.	2
continue to be a member of that community without the community permanently tying what happened to me to my identity.	2
everyone I talked to would then associate it with my identity and it would be something I would never escape.	2
Even on reddit i was originally hesitant to be open about it because of the username system would tie it to my reddit identity.	2
But on 4chan I could discuss it all i wanted and it was a massive emotional relief.	2
In real life you don't know if your emotional troubles are going to annoy or be a burden to whoever is kind enough to listen,	2
on 4chan style board, if no one cares they're not going to respond and if they feel your problems are stupid they grant you the right to start over immediately and don't force anyone to carry their past with them.	2
the site however doesn't create these people it merely attracts them and for many like myself, helps them get out of that mindset in their real life.	2
I've been browsing that site for 10 years,	2
arguably i'm more optimistic and positive because i've been exposed to that raw humanity.	2
CMV: I believe that regularly browsing 4chan will make you into a worse person	1
Surrounding yourself with this will in general make you into a more pessimistic, negative and possibly depressive person.	1
I'm not saying that every person who browses 4chan is depressed or negative	1
that the majority of them are affected negatively by browsing the site	1
Thinking that you are unaffected by this doesn't necessarily mean you are, but instead means that you are unaware of how much it affects you.	1
To be fair that's not specific to 4chan	1
It's also a product of individual stupidity,	1
As for 4chan making people into a worse person, I would strong disagree.	1
the only way I would ever describe it would be *chaotic neutral*.	1
The problem is a lot of people only understand the surface of chan boards like 4chan	1
To understand why the board encourages to *hate* is to understand who goes there	1
it's obviously the social outcasts.	1
Quite honestly it dilutes it.	1
4chan style sites don't create pessimistic, negative, and depressed people it just attracts them	1
It's wonderful because I can let it all out	1
If I fully discussed my rape irl i was always going to feel broken	1
It's the mindset i got from 4chan that helps me and others move on from our problems, that we shouldn't drag them around to each *new thing* we do but instead move on and start over.	1
It's this aspect that attracts the people you describe,	1
As it seems you hold the belief that even if people like myself don't feel they are being effected by this site negatively,	1
you are insisting they are and are just ignorant to their own emotions and experiences.	1

http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rawgb/cmv_i_believe_that_regularly_browsing_4chan_will/	0
Because of the anonymity on 4chan people are more prone to not think through, care about what they post and are quicker to throw out insults.	0
They will care about how people respond to them, but since it's largely negative they will stoop down to the same level rather than go to any high ground since they are not linked to an identity.	0
Surrounding the entire site there's a general pessimistic group mentality, and people are subconsciously encouraged to take part of it in order to feel like they are a part of the group.	0
Some boards will have specific groups of people who they are encouraged to hate, women, SJWs, casual gamers, Jews, and any reasonable argument against a poster can be made redundant by saying or thinking they are a part of these agendas or groups.	0
On boards you will find echo chambers where people are more prone to believe rumors than proof.	0
Things about e-celebrities will start as rumors, ideas about them or things will get taken out of context and it will be posted continually until it's taken as fact.	0
It will reach conspiracy theory levels of "proof" where people will simply believe it because they feel as if they are a part of a group-effort that's uncovering something.	0

To be fair that's not specific to 4chan  and  that phenomenon has been around forever   (Tumblr's community is heavily guilty of this same thing).	0
It's also a product of individual stupidity,   if your believing something random people are telling you without it being backed by proof and your own individual research,  well that's your own gullibility.	0
As for 4chan making people into a worse person, I would strong disagree.	0
I'd say more it just lets people be free, free to test the waters  and  do whatever without your idea's, jokes, concepts tied to any identity.	0
Every thought stands of its own individual merits.	0

This would have most of the benefits as with what I imagined with guns except it might be less probable to work against well prepared attackers (against heavy clothing),	2
it could also deter from suicide attacks as they usually count on not being caught alive and of course it always is best for the attacker to be brought to justice in court.	2
CMV: I think the Paris shooting makes a good case for culture of responsible gun ownership any carrying.	1
I think France is in a tough spot in how to react to this.	1
I think it would be a shame to allow the many, who are afraid more then anything, to be swayed by xenophobic nationalists (which might have been the goal of the attack anyway).	1
I think this, regardless of whether the weapons used by the attackers were owned legally, makes a good case for promoting a culture of a reasonable gun ownership and carrying.	1
I also think this would be much better then increase in police numbers and rights	1

PS: I am not here to talk about USA and its gun problems.	0
EDIT: Awarded a delta to a comment which didn't refute this idea but led me to change my view that it would be best realized with paralyzing weapons rather then guns: http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rnr30/cmv_i_think_the_paris_shooting_makes_a_good_case/cni3o83	0
I guess I look at it this way- there have absolutely been times when gun ownership, or carrying weapons on ones person in general was more prevalent than it is today.	0
Those time periods/places did not enjoy lower rates of violent death.	0
Consider the "wild west."	0
Obviously it wasn't nearly as full of gun battles as the movies make it seem, but according [this study] (http://cjrc.osu.edu/homicide-rates-american-west-randolph-roth)	0
the murder rate was "extraordinarily high by today's standard."	0
Looking at the rest of the thread, I think I see what might be a flaw in our collective logic.	0
The incidents that stand out most in our heads are events like Paris or Aurora or Columbine- premeditated shootings with the intent of inflicting a lot of casualties.	0
If the staff at Charlie Hebdo or Columbine High had guns, they certainly might have been able to end these incidents earlier.	0
They also might have inflicted more casualties with stray bullets.	0
These types of hypothetical calculations aren't really helpful, in my opinion.	0
But lets assume that more guns makes mass shootings less likely.	0
Would this actually make a more heavily armed society a more polite one?	0
I don't think it would, because though premeditated murders could well be less likely, accidental deaths, unplanned homicides, and suicides would like increase.	0
This study found that owning a gun makes one more likely to die from suicide *and* homicide.	0
Of course, that's correlation, so there might be some third factor at play that makes gun owners more likely to b targets of crime or clinically depressed, but it certainly suggests that owning a gun doesn't automatically make you safer.	0
http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/160/10/929.full	0
	0
Whether or not more guns would prevent events like today's isn't the issue (though I am inclined to say they wouldn't necessarily do that), it seems like a greater proliferation of weapons would be more dangerous for a number of other reasons.	0
Yeah I was considering this and was already doubtful of the benefits would outweigh the potential negatives.	0
I'm sure with the right culture it would, but maintaining a culture is hard.	0
Like I said the role of these people would be to defend themselves and those around them.	0
It wouldn't help deterring suicide attacks, and would most probably cause few more deaths from mistakes and irresponsibility, with a danger of this worsening.	0
In cases of mass shootings like you outlined, which are the situations I am thinking of, it would perhaps be best that these people wouldn't be armed with a gun but a paralyzer (taser), so when they find a safe hiding place or cover they have a chance getting themselves in a position where they can use the paralyzer on the attacker.	0
This would have most of the benefits as with what I imagined with guns except it might be less probable to work against well prepared attackers (against heavy clothing), but on the other hand it could also deter from suicide attacks as they usually count on not being caught alive and of course it always is best for the attacker to be brought to justice in court.	0

It's really not that difficult with a little common sense!	2
It's worth it dammit!	2
you bought an RPG!	2
You're already taking a good bit time to play the game	2
You get so much more out of the experience if you just take the time to explore.	2
I do agree with most of the criticisms of the plot and that it could have been much better than what it was	2
With only a couple exceptions, the vast majority of Shepard's crew are interesting, fleshed-out characters, each with their own flaws and redeeming qualities.	2
seeing Wrex grow from a mere gun-for-hire in ME1 to the responsible, yet still badass leader of the Genophage-free Krogan in ME3 was one of the most gratifying experiences of my gaming career.	2
the leap of faith Shepard takes when trusting Legion on Rannoch, thus ending hundreds of years of conflict and bringing the Quarians and Geth together was immensely satisfying and could easily qualify for /r/frission material.	2
Without these experiences, yeah, Mass Effect 3 didn't live up to the hype	2
It's such a hollow victory watching Wreav royally screw things up, or watching Tali commit suicide.	2
It was there to be seen by players and to be experienced by them.	2
And sometimes, tragedies are more fun than victories.	2
I had a closeted gay paragon Shepard because I thought it was hilarious and he eventually shacked up with Kaidan, saved the world, let no one die, then picked destroy ending because why not.	2
It went - well, okay, I guess.	2
I thought you know what, I want a Shepard where this kind of ending makes sense.	2
And so I made the world's giantest asshole most self-justifying Shepard	2
It's about as far as you can get from *your* completionist Shepard	2
taken with ME3's ending, I think it makes for a far better story	2
A renegade lady who wasn't *xenophobic* as much as *very* pro-human, straight but distrusted Jacob and uninterested in any of the alien male love interests (and who killed Kaidan in ME1, woops).	2
Who was alone from start to end in a quest that only she seemed to really believe in.	2
It's basically the game going 'well Shepard, you fucked up, and this is what you get for it'.	2
The entire game and story turns into Shepard realizing too late that things could've been different and that the state of the universe going to shit is on *them*.	2
The finale of ME3 goes from a completely unsatisfying throughly annoying ending that ignored the themes of choice and self-determination that had been going on through the game into one final, desperate chance to make it right, instead.	2
Whatever Shepard picks, I felt a lot more satisfied with *that* story as a whole instead of the 'no one dies' run where it didn't really matter that no one died and that they worked so fucking hard for that - just pick choice A, B or C and that's your ending for you.	2
Shitty failure Shepard's ending was also a dialogue choice, but that just underscored that she'd burned and destroyed anything else around her	2
Every other *possible* ending that could've been, she'd gone and wrecked through her own shitty actions.	2
Losing all the choices at the end made *sense*, this time, in the context of her experiences.	2
I don't think of it as *me* killing of those characters off, it's whatever Shepard I'm playing in that particular runthrough that's doing it - a vicious, angry, bitter and ultimately futile Shepard.	2
The emotional payoff on finishing the series went from 'are you serious is that actually the ending, the fuck' to 'HAHA YES, Shepard fucking deserved that, that was *great*'.	2
For me, that wasn't a completionist run.	2
CMV: There is only one "right" way to play the Mass Effect series (spoilers)	1
a.) incompetent	1
rushing/missing the damn point of the game	1
unfit to fairly criticize the series	1
the real heart of the Mass Effect franchise lies not with the story or the narrative, but with its characters	1
it's a complete waste of the player's time going about it that way.	1
there is one right way to play Mass Effect: a completionist run where NO ONE dies.	1
if the material is in the game, it's there for a purpose.	1
I did do the completionist run!	1
However, after that, I wanted some real emotional punches.	1
when you play a character who's a lot more of an asshole but who's a really *determined* asshole, who keeps losing stuff and who has people die but who convinces herself that it's *worth* something, that her mission has to be worth all that, who is willing to make sacrifices that she believes are necessary (when you, the player, know that they aren't) - the 'bad ends' in ME3 make for a fantastic experience.	1
They're not hollow at all, they're fantastic.	1
To me, that kind of ending fit much better with the way I'd played her, and I felt far more vicious satisfaction putting that sort of character through it.	1
the 'everyone dies' route, seeing as it *is* there, also was meant to be played and in fact works pretty well as an overall story where Shepard is the one that's screwed up the whole way	1
The right way to play it is to experience everything that is there, and then figure out what makes you the most satisfied.	1
The one I find the most hilarious and interesting is the one whose story makes the most sense as a whole, and that's the one where Shepard totally fails save anyone, including herself.	1

You get so much more out of the experience if you just take the time to explore.	0
c.) unfit to fairly criticize the series	0
Firstly, I want to say that I do agree with most of the criticisms of the plot and that it could have been much better than what it was (see the original Kapysharn plot outline for details).	0
However despite its shortcomings, I believe that the real heart of the Mass Effect franchise lies not with the story or the narrative, but with its characters.	0
With only a couple exceptions, the vast majority of Shepard's crew are interesting, fleshed-out characters, each with their own flaws and redeeming qualities.	0
For example, (SPOILERS ME3) seeing Wrex grow from a mere gun-for-hire in ME1 to the responsible, yet still badass leader of the Genophage-free Krogan in ME3 was one of the most gratifying experiences of my gaming career.	0
Similarly, the leap of faith Shepard takes when trusting Legion on Rannoch, thus ending hundreds of years of conflict and bringing the Quarians and Geth together was immensely satisfying and could easily qualify for /r/frission material.	0
Without these experiences, yeah, Mass Effect 3 didn't live up to the hype.	0
How could it?	0
It's such a hollow victory watching Wreav royally screw things up, or watching Tali commit suicide.	0
In my opinion, it's a complete waste of the player's time going about it that way.	0
Regardless of paragon or renegade alignment, I believe there is one right way to play Mass Effect: a completionist run where NO ONE dies.	0
I need help guys.	0
It's getting to the point where I can't even discuss Mass Effect with others without judging someone for letting my favorite characters bite the bullet.	0
Hell, I've put one of my friends off playing the games because I was backseat-gaming during his playthrough.	0
I WANT to believe that games should be played however the player wants to play them, but for whatever reason it's different for me when it comes to Mass Effect in particular.	0
Please, CMV!	0
EDIT: Just wanted to say that I don't take issue with making an intentionally flawed Shepard to see what it looks like. It's just I feel that some who were more critical of the game could've missed out on an important and fulfilling character later on because I a mistake, and that could have potentially negatively color their views and the public perception of the game as a whole.	0
Bah, apologies! I'm rambling, it's late, but I look forward to catching up with your comments tomorrow first thing! Thanks guys!	0
Or maybe you just like plots and characters and different stories.	0
I'd say my approach was different - if the material is in the game, it's there for a purpose.	0
It was there to be seen by players and to be experienced by them. And sometimes, tragedies are more fun than victories.	0
I did do the completionist run!	0
I had a closeted gay paragon Shepard because I thought it was hilarious and he eventually shacked up with Kaidan, saved the world, let no one die, then picked destroy ending because why not.	0
It went - well, okay, I guess.	0
However, after that, I wanted some real emotional punches.	0
I was *pissed as hell* at the [ME3 ending](http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/17ik93m5xahnwpng/original.png) (and I don't think, as another fan, you'll need me to elaborate on why - I loved those characters and I hated how little involvement they had in how things went, and the ending was a total slap in the face to the player and all their work until that point) so I thought you know what, I want a Shepard where this kind of ending makes sense.	0
Where an ending that's a fuck you to everything Shepard's been trying comes as the topping of a fuck you in the chain of everything that Shepard's done.	0
Where it isn't a betrayal of all the themes that have been brought up so far but the logical extension of them instead.	0
And so I made the world's giantest asshole most self-justifying Shepard.	0
And if you ask me?	0
It's about as far as you can get from *your* completionist Shepard, but taken with ME3's ending, I think it makes for a far better story.	0
A renegade lady who wasn't *xenophobic* as much as *very* pro-human, straight but distrusted Jacob and uninterested in any of the alien male love interests (and who killed Kaidan in ME1, woops).	0
Who was alone from start to end in a quest that only she seemed to really believe in.	0
Trust me, when you play a character who's a lot more of an asshole but who's a really *determined* asshole, who keeps losing stuff and who has people die but who convinces herself that it's *worth* something, that her mission has to be worth all that, who is willing to make sacrifices that she believes are necessary (when you, the player, know that they aren't) - the 'bad ends' in ME3 make for a fantastic experience.	0
It's basically the game going 'well Shepard, you fucked up, and this is what you get for it'.	0
They're not hollow at all, they're fantastic.	0
The entire game and story turns into Shepard realizing too late that things could've been different and that the state of the universe going to shit is on *them*. They lose everyone who trusted them in some way or another, and *hurt* through it all.	0
The finale of ME3 goes from a completely unsatisfying throughly annoying ending that ignored the themes of choice and self-determination that had been going on through the game into one final, desperate chance to make it right, instead.	0
Whatever Shepard picks, I felt a lot more satisfied with *that* story as a whole instead of the 'no one dies' run where it didn't really matter that no one died and that they worked so fucking hard for that - just pick choice A, B or C and that's your ending for you.	0
Shitty failure Shepard's ending was also a dialogue choice, but that just underscored that she'd burned and destroyed anything else around her - that no one else would stand by her side, that everyone was dead and this was all she had left.	0
To me, that kind of ending fit much better with the way I'd played her, and I felt far more vicious satisfaction putting that sort of character through it.	0
Every other *possible* ending that could've been, she'd gone and wrecked through her own shitty actions.	0
Losing all the choices at the end made *sense*, this time, in the context of her experiences.	0
Anyway, I still enjoyed the everyone-lives playthrough, but I'd say that the 'everyone dies' route, seeing as it *is* there, also was meant to be played and in fact works pretty well as an overall story where Shepard is the one that's screwed up the whole way.	0
I don't think of it as *me* killing of those characters off, it's whatever Shepard I'm playing in that particular runthrough that's doing it - a vicious, angry, bitter and ultimately futile Shepard.	0
The emotional payoff on finishing the series went from 'are you serious is that actually the ending, the fuck' to 'HAHA YES, Shepard fucking deserved that, that was *great*'.	0
TL;DR: The right way to play it is to experience everything that is there, and then figure out what makes you the most satisfied.	0
For me, that wasn't a completionist run.	0
I can play as 'saves everyone' Shepard and also as 'total stupid asshole' Shepard - neither of them are me-the-player, they're just the main characters in their own stories.	0
The one I find the most hilarious and interesting is the one whose story makes the most sense as a whole, and that's the one where Shepard totally fails save anyone, including herself.	0
**Edit:** Also, OP, if you're complaining that people who let companions die miss out on content later in the game, you should consider that as a person who played through ME several times (these weren't actually my only Shepards, I have also tried every romance because I wanted to see what all the fuss was about), I've actually experienced far more of it than you have.	0
The 'but you see less of it if you do this other route' ignores that you can just *play the game again*.	0
	0
Thanks for your post! I suppose I hadn't really though to consider the complexities of a "shitty-Shep" in relation to the flaws of the game itself.	0
The absence of certain characters is valid too, even though losing squadmembers would be more somber than I'd personally prefer.	0
Almost poetic in a way, but I think I'll stick to going the long way around if I'm going to invest any time in another (one of at least five runs since it came out, btw) full Mass Effect runthrough. ;)	0
I suppose I should have mentioned that this would be in the case of a person doing a "final" canon run for THEIR Shep, and making those decisions on who to save and what to do.	0
Like, most people don't memorize all of Romeo and Juliet.	2
But most people, I think, if they really wanted to, **could.**	2
I'm 100% on board with trashing the US constitution and starting from scratch with new documents, so appealing to the constitution is not on topic.	2
I think the American legal system has gotten out of hand in complexity.	2
By categories, I mean things like: criminal law; the tax code; any given category of regulation by profession (medical, construction, IT, and so on).	2
I don't think you'll find many people who disagree that the American legal system could be slimmed down substantially.	2
First, take criminal law.	2
Let's assume that laws are created on the premise that they outlaw an action that is morally bad	2
Some things are clear cut - hitting a small child would be morally bad.	2
Going down this train of logic will ultimately lead to a purely utilitarian theory on the legal system	2
That isn't to say that it would be better or worse than our's currently	2
given the immense literature on utilitarianism I doubt any high schooler could reasonably be expected to memorize it.	2
Second, let's look at regulation by profession, specifically bank regulation	2
It's a 800-odd page legislative titan	2
Take the Volcker rule and prop. trading.	2
That's explicitly illegal now (well, kind of... not yet).	2
There isn't a huge moral justification to regulations such as these other than 'they increase risk and excessive risk is bad'.	2
Some of these things just ultimately need someone saying "Enough!	2
We'll agree on 5% or we will agree to disagree." and to codify it.	2
However, that codification, even if is only one line applied to hundreds of laws, would be immense.	2
CMV: Any given aspect of the legal system should be short and simple enough that an average high school graduate could fully memorize it	1
simple enough that almost anyone could, if they were struck by the impulse to make that unusually large commitment, do so	1
I think the law should be simple enough that close to anybody could reasonably know the mechanics of all the laws likely to apply to them.	1
Ideally, it should be a relatively simple feat of memorization to learn the names of all the categories of law; the number of laws in each category; and the basic mechanics of the enforcement of that category's laws.	1
it should be well within the average citizen's capacity to know all the laws likely to apply to them, word-for-word or close to it.	1
I entirely agree that certain parts are unnecessarily complex and complicated	1
a substantial degree of complexity is necessary for certain aspects to function.	1
a lot of it is necessary for a functional judicial system to determine what is and is not legal.	1
We could create a system that simply pointed to morally impermissible actions as illegal, but that would lead to large discrepancies (or would need have some other system to define what is morally impermissible, out of scope of a high schooler's memory).	1
In order to eliminate discrepancies, the system needs to codify at least some specific instances, and by doing such for an immense number of actions we go beyond, well, *any* one person's memory.	1

I'll make two quick points with the idea of persuading you that, while it should be simplified, a substantial degree of complexity is necessary for certain aspects to function.	0
First, take criminal law.	0
Let's assume that laws are created on the premise that they outlaw an action that is morally bad.	0
That sounds fine and dandy at first, but who defines what is morally bad?	0
Some things are clear cut - hitting a small child would be morally bad.	0
But what if hitting them prevented some greater harm?	0

That's explicitly illegal now (well, kind of... not yet).	0
There isn't a huge moral justification to regulations such as these other than 'they increase risk and excessive risk is bad'.	0
But who defines what excessive risk is?	0
If you have a probability of default of 50% is that bad?	0
Is 15% acceptable?	0
What about 5%?	0
Even better, what about 4.99999% versus 5%?	0
Some of these things just ultimately need someone saying "Enough!	0
We'll agree on 5% or we will agree to disagree." and to codify it.	0
However, that codification, even if is only one line applied to hundreds of laws, would be immense.	0
In short, my two points were: 1. We could create a system that simply pointed to morally impermissible actions as illegal, but that would lead to large discrepancies (or would need have some other system to define what is morally impermissible, out of scope of a high schooler's memory).	0
2.	0

 I'm giving you a delta btw because thinking about it your post has made it obvious to me that the list of subcategories would be bigger than I initially anticipated, and might itself be a pretty significant feat of memorization.	0
But I still think it should be within the scope of countability and basically anyone should be aware of all the sets of laws that they need to worry about.	0

The main objection to this, of course, will be that the extended cuts are able to include more scenes from the books, and are therefore better.	2
They stretched some scenes from brief chapters into center pieces (Helms's Deep) and cut out some of the more... esoteric portions completely (Tom Bombadil).	2
And I tried.	2
I loved The Hobbit, even though it got slow	2
I found Tolkien's prose to be far too slow-paced and filled with inane babbling about things too far removed from the plot.	2

I'm the sort of person who, despite not really liking to read, will read summaries about the world surrounding my favorite movies or video games	2
these are things I *want to know* but typically aren't in the film/game, so I endure the chore.	2

There seems to be a commonly held belief that people who cheat on their SO/partner should be dropped immediately with no further contact.	2
in some cases, there are many worse things that can happen in a relationship, which couples seem to be able to work through.	2
**Sex is the most important part of a relationship,** and therefore, betraying it and that agreement mean the relationship should end.	2
**Nobody makes mistakes ever,** so when they do, the relationship should end.	2
**Cheaters will always cheat again,** so better to end it now.	2
other than anecdotal evidence, I haven't seen anything to support this claim.	2
**Cheaters cheat because of underlying issues with the relationship.**	2
such as ... talking about the problem.	2
Maybe fixing that issue will resolve the motivation to cheat.	2
I'l begin by saying it has never happened to me	2
even if you value it not at all, cheating breaks other important parts of the relationship.	2
Like trust.	2
Loyalty.	2
Companionship.	2
However, cheating on a spouse is *pretty big mistake*.	2
A bad choice which breaks one of the cornerstones of marriage.	2
The circumstances that resulted in cheating the first time may repeat.	2
It often doesn't work out so well that way.	2
People get stuck in a pattern... living in the same house, married to the same person you stopped really caring about.	2
Cheating is evidence that *something* must be wrong.	2
Are there no situations in which the cheaters should be forgiven?	2
I point out, cheating has a profound negative emotional effect of the person cheated on.	2
One partner isn't fulfilling all of his/her obligations (i.e. not to cheat)	2
So why should the other person be obligated to fill out his/hers?	2
Why should you stay married?	2
It's an ethical question	2
everyone has their different values	2
It's a choice.	2
But if you don't break up, you are stuck with a person who doesn't value you enough to stay loyal.	2
Why would you forfeit yourself to such a relationship?	2
Things need change.	2
And the cheater is the source of the problem.	2
CMV: People who cheat on their spouses can and should, in some cases, be forgiven	1
I understand that physical/sexual conduct with another person can seem like a betrayal	1
There are a few assumptions underlying the belief that "sex with another person = relationship over" that I don't think hold up.	1
My belief: sex is a very important part of a relationship, but not *the* most important part.	1
My belief: obviously this isn't true, and a cornerstone of strong relationships is the ability to work through mistakes/issues together.	1
my view: That may be true in some cases	1
My belief: if that's true, there are a lot of possibilities - not just breaking up - that could fix the problem	1
Caveat: sometimes, cheating happens because there are parts of the relationship that are fundamentally broken and/or the relationship is too far gone/unsalvageable and/or this is the straw the broke the camel's back etc.	1
Cheating shouldn't always signify an immediate end to a relationship.	1
In some cases, couples can and should choose to work through it	1
you make some good points.	1
To break it would be to break one of the most important parts of a marriage	1
You are correct that this is false.	1
Cheating, as I define it, is a choice.	1
You are correct that this is false.	1
However, I would say that *cheaters are more likely to cheat again*.	1
Yes.	1
But "talking about the problem" is an ideal situation.	1
is a bad choice which breaks one of the cornerstones of a relationship	1
is an indication that such a thing will happen again	1
is an indication that there is a problem with the relationship	1
I'm trying to argue that if you find your spouse cheating, breaking up with them is the most logical thing to do, whatever the circumstances.	1
In my mind, marriage is a commitment.	1
If you break that commitment, the marriage is broken.	1
It is entirely up to the person making the decision as to what they may do.	1
it's impossible to prove definitively what you should/should not do.	1
It's just a logical conclusion that breaking up is the right choice in most if not all situations.	1
Change the cheater by breaking up with him/her.	1

* **Cheaters cheat because of underlying issues with the relationship.** My belief: if that's true, there are a lot of possibilities - not just breaking up - that could fix the problem, such as ... talking about the problem.	0

CMV!	0
I'l begin by saying it has never happened to me, and you make some good points.	0
But I'm addicted to CMV, so here we go.	0
>sex is a very important part of a relationship, but not the most important part.	0
So it is one of the most important parts.	0
To break it would be to break one of the most important parts of a marriage.	0
I'll continue.	0
*edit: even if you value it not at all, cheating breaks other important parts of the relationship.	0
Like trust.	0
Loyalty.	0
Companionship.	0
>Nobody makes mistakes ever, so when they do, the relationship should end.	0
You are correct that this is false.	0
However, cheating on a spouse is *pretty big mistake*.	0
Cheating, as I define it, is a choice.	0
A bad choice which breaks one of the cornerstones of marriage.	0
>Cheaters will always cheat again	0
You are correct that this is false.	0
However, I would say that *cheaters are more likely to cheat again*. The circumstances that resulted in cheating the first time may repeat.	0
>Cheaters cheat because of underlying issues with the relationship. My belief: if that's true, there are a lot of possibilities - not just breaking up - that could fix the problem, such as ... talking about the problem.	0
Yes.	0
But "talking about the problem" is an ideal situation.	0
It often doesn't work out so well that way.	0
People get stuck in a pattern... living in the same house, married to the same person you stopped really caring about.	0
Cheating is evidence that *something* must be wrong.	0
So, so far we can say cheating	0
* is a bad choice which breaks one of the cornerstones of a relationship	0
* is an indication that such a thing will happen again	0
* is an indication that there is a problem with the relationship	0
Are there no situations in which the cheaters should be forgiven? I'm trying to argue that if you find your spouse cheating, breaking up with them is the most logical thing to do, whatever the circumstances.	0
I point out, cheating has a profound negative emotional effect of the person cheated on.	0
You have every reason to break up.	0
In my mind, marriage is a commitment.	0
If you break that commitment, the marriage is broken.	0
One partner isn't fulfilling all of his/her obligations (i.e. not to cheat) So why should the other person be obligated to fill out his/hers?	0
Why should you stay married?	0
It is entirely up to the person making the decision as to what they may do.	0
It's an ethical question, and everyone has their different values, so it's impossible to prove definitively what you should/should not do.	0
It's just a logical conclusion that breaking up is the right choice in most if not all situations.	0
It's a choice.	0
But if you don't break up, you are stuck with a person who doesn't value you enough to stay loyal.	0
Why would you forfeit yourself to such a relationship?	0
Things need change.	0
And the cheater is the source of the problem.	0
Change the cheater by breaking up with him/her.	0
	0
> marriage is a commitment. If you break that commitment, the marriage is broken.	0
This is the best argument I've heard so far.	0

The DSM-IV defines delusion as:	2
A false belief based on incorrect inference about external reality that is firmly sustained despite what almost everyone else believes and despite what constitutes incontrovertible and obvious proof or evidence to the contrary.	2
If someone walks around genuinely convinced they are Jesus, the person is delusional	2
others would want to see that person medicated or receiving some form of psychiatric treatment for that persons own benefit.	2
But out of fear of offending and looking like an insensitive bigot, no one would respond to an otherkin in the same way they would someone claiming ultimate divinity.	2
Since you mentioned the DSM IV, it is worth pointing out that all of the disorders listed in the DSM IV have one central piece of criteria that is at the heart of the diagnostic process	2
that has to do with the degree to which the disorder is disruptive not only to the person who has the disorder, but to the general public as well	2
Take for instance being "taken by the holy spirit".	2
From an outside perspective, this certainly appears to me to be a delusional behavior, but of course this alone is not enough for it to meet the criteria of a particular disorder.	2
As people can engage in all kinds of delusional behavior and often still function in the world quite well, this is not sufficient evidence for whether or not something should or should not be constituted as evidence of a disorder.	2
The belief that one has an animal spirit is not new and has been a component of many primitive animistic cultures throughout history	2
certain Native American practices still have vestiges of this	2
most of us wouldn't describe them as "delusional" simply because they follow the traditions of their ancestors as they've been practiced for centuries.	2
I forgot that one of the main diagnostic criteria for almost any mental disorder is the impact it has on the persons well-being	2
CMV: Otherkin are delusional and should be treated as such	1
Otherkin, or animalkin, the belief that their soul is an animal or something nonhuman, fit this definition	1
should be urged to seek psychiatric evaluation rather than joining communities of similar "kin."	1
We should not encourage and accept otherkin behavior, but rather encourage seeking treatment for a delusional disorder.	1
Generally speaking, delusions themselves are arguably less relevant to whether or not a behavior is indicative of a disorder than are the social repercussions of that behavior.	1
While you may find the practice disingenuous or disgusting, this is not reason enough to hold the behavior as evidence of a specific disorder in and of itself	1
in cases where there may be genuine mental illness involved, I believe that there's enough criteria already set forth in the DSM to diagnose these conditions accurately without directly addressing this particular cultural phenomenon as some kind of mental health outlier.	1
You're right.	1
if someone is generally in a better state identifying as an otherkin, then there would be no real need to treat them, unless they started disrupting the lives of others.	1

someone were forced to stick to a single exercise technique	2
cardio, able to be done at a variety of speeds over a variety of distances, making it suitable for a wide range of fitness levels	2
resistance in many muscle groups, especially when strokes in question are varied and tools such as fins or kickboards are added	2
low-impact, making it suitable for older people, people with recent injuries, or those with longer-term joint problems	2
whole-body (or at least most-of-the-body)	2

Every exercise I can think of can be done *at a variety of speeds over a variety of distances*.	1
This is the fundamental problem with all body-weight exercises.	1
Best for people with issues != best for people without issues or best overall.	1
it's important to workout your whole body	1
there is a reason that most weight-lifting routines isolate different areas	1
weight lifting is by far the best	1
the squat is often referred to as one of the best	1
It's also the most beneficial for older people	1
Best regimen just depends on your goals	1
I think some of the better weight lifting routines are more efficient at achieving just about any goal you can think of, except cardiovascular endurance.	1

As I understand it, and crudely explained, SVT says that in an economic system that lets people hire other people for labour	2
Consider a society of 101 people: 100 workers and 1 boss.	2
The boss owns the factory where the workers work	2
they produce, say, MLP dolls that everyone wants to buy	2
The boss pays each of her workers £5 for each doll that the worker produces, and a worker produces 1 doll a day	2
At the end of the day, the boss has 100 dolls, worth £1000 and has paid out £500	2
Wanting to make a profit on the dolls, the boss then sells the dolls for £10 each.	2
She is now trying to sell £1000 worth of dolls	2
the only people available to sell to are the workers, who's total funds are £500	2
No matter how they rearrange the money between them, they will be unable to buy more than £500 worth of the dolls	2
the rest are waste inherent to the system and a direct result of the boss wanting to make profit.	2
This example then scales up to the whole world when you throw in multiple bosses and lots more workers but the basic idea is the same	2
each worker is being paid less than the price of the things they produce so that their boss can profit	2
Most people aren't paid on commission	2
you're neglecting the janitor who is necessary to keep the factory functioning (and presumably gets paid) but doesn't "produce" anything.	2
when this system scales up you need to include the boss buying things.	2
whatever profit the boss makes goes back into the system as they spend money	2
This value may not be the price being charged for the thing	2
sometimes (or a lot of the time) the boss just hoards their extra money and doesn't re-inject it	2
it won't sell and will be waste	2
the seller overpriced it	2
not because it was doomed to be waste as soon as it was made.	2
you mean to say that real-life capitalism is inefficient	2
CMV: Surplus Value Theorem is definitive proof that capitalism is an inefficient system.	1
waste has to be produced in order for the system to function	1
items that cannot be sold must still be produced and thrown away.	1
this isn't really a good example	1
I think I get where you're going with it.	1
But the money doesn't just disappear.	1
there should be at all times enough money in the system to cover the value of what it produced	1
that's where supply and demand are involved	1
that's more a failure of the system than the system itself	1
The same goes for when something is priced above its market value	1
No ideal system is really going to be inefficient	1
its the real ones that have problems.	1
no one is going to dispute you	1
it's the most efficient real system we have	1
it would be a wasteless system if there were multiple factories and the boss spent all of their money!	1

This value may not be the price being charged for the thing, and that's where supply and demand are involved.	0
I'm not going to deny that sometimes (or a lot of the time) the boss just hoards their extra money and doesn't re-inject it, but that's more a failure of the system than the system itself.	0
The same goes for when something is priced above its market value, it won't sell and will be waste, but that's because the seller overpriced it, not because it was doomed to be waste as soon as it was made.	0
No ideal system is really going to be inefficient, its the real ones that have problems.	0
If you mean to say that real-life capitalism is inefficient, then no one is going to dispute you, but I will point out that it's the most efficient real system we have.	0
	0
That makes a lot of sense!	0
Thank you! I can accept that it would be a wasteless system if there were multiple factories and the boss spent all of their money!	0
I can definitely think of other bits of inefficiency but that wasn't the question so nevermind! :)	0
As I understand it, and crudely explained, SVT says that in an economic system that lets people hire other people for labour	2
Consider a society of 101 people: 100 workers and 1 boss.	2
The boss owns the factory where the workers work	2
they produce, say, MLP dolls that everyone wants to buy	2
The boss pays each of her workers £5 for each doll that the worker produces, and a worker produces 1 doll a day	2
At the end of the day, the boss has 100 dolls, worth £1000 and has paid out £500	2
Wanting to make a profit on the dolls, the boss then sells the dolls for £10 each.	2
She is now trying to sell £1000 worth of dolls	2
the only people available to sell to are the workers, who's total funds are £500	2
No matter how they rearrange the money between them, they will be unable to buy more than £500 worth of the dolls	2
the rest are waste inherent to the system and a direct result of the boss wanting to make profit.	2
This example then scales up to the whole world when you throw in multiple bosses and lots more workers but the basic idea is the same	2
each worker is being paid less than the price of the things they produce so that their boss can profit	2
a single worker, who owns all of his own tools (that he made himself), makes a doll out of parts he gathers or makes at no cost to himself	2
The doll is worth $10.	2
no one in this system actually has $10	2
no one can buy that doll	2
typically most companies aren't owned by the "bosses"	2
They are owned by the owners of the company, which are many and varied, often including the workers in many cases	2
The excess value goes to all of them, who spend it on many things	2
some of it is retained as capital by the owners	2
what does that really mean?	2
They invest it in other productive stuff, such as new factories that produce *more* stuff (someone has to pay the people that build the factories)	2
money that is borrowed by people to start their own businesses	2
some businesses fail	2
in the process of being "wasted", it ended up going to other people for the businesses purchases, payrolls, etc	2
the businesses that succeed end up generating *more* economic activity.	2
In communism, surplus value is also either created	2
shortage occurs because not enough was produced	2
real-world examples of communist states	2
"wastes" a lot of it in overhead and useless production	2
in some kinds of communism	2
Other systems have less incentive for these corrections to happen	2
the people making the decisions about production don't have as much incentive to get those decisions right	2
CMV: Surplus Value Theorem is definitive proof that capitalism is an inefficient system.	1
waste has to be produced in order for the system to function	1
items that cannot be sold must still be produced and thrown away.	1
This is one of those views that likes to view production, capital, labor, and all of economics as a zero sum game.	1
It's not.	1
Money circulates multiple times in a system	1
value is created at each stage	1
you're simplifying it down to a level where it doesn't show all of the uses of the money that actually happen	1
I could reduce this down to the absolute simplest case and thus reduce the entire argument to absurdity	1
it goes to waste	1
it leaves out a lot of economic activity outside of the example shown	1
Nothing about scaling that up to a factory changes the reasoning	1
The reasoning is just oversimplified and wrong	1
all of the money received by the factory for the dolls goes to someone	1
People don't actually "horde" money in couches.	1
that is by and large where most of the "surplus value" is "wasted"	1
only in a very narrow sense	1
This is no different from any other system	1
The only difference is where the money goes	1
the money goes to the state	1
it goes back to the workers	1
factory owners have a lot of ways of disposing of excess inventory, and a lot of incentive to not *create* excess inventory in the first place	1
end up generating even more waste	1

They are owned by the owners of the company, which are many and varied, often including the workers in many cases.	0

But only in a very narrow sense, because in the process of being "wasted", it ended up going to other people for the businesses purchases, payrolls, etc.	0
Additionally, the businesses that succeed end up generating *more* economic activity.	0
This is no different from any other system, BTW.	0
In communism, surplus value is also either created (or, alternately and more likely, a shortage occurs because not enough was produced).	0
The only difference is where the money goes.	0
In real-world examples of communist states, the money goes to the state, which "wastes" a lot of it in overhead and useless production as well.	0

Another problem with your view is that factory owners have a lot of ways of disposing of excess inventory, and a lot of incentive to not *create* excess inventory in the first place.	0
Other systems have less incentive for these corrections to happen, and as a practical matter end up generating even more waste, because the people making the decisions about production don't have as much incentive to get those decisions right.	0

Maybe for you, every relationship with a woman is motivated by romance.	2
For someone other hetero guy it might not be.	2
you're in a lifelong comitted closed relationship	2
you'll still probably feel attraction for other people	2

None.	2
And we try to define all of these interactions between the sexes as one thing or another because it's easy.	2
But it really isn't.	2
I can think a girl is absolutely gorgeous and still be friends with them, mostly because I don't think she's the one for me.	2
just because I don't feel like I want to keep someone exclusively to myself doesn't mean I care for them any less.	2
And just trying to be romantic with women, assuming the endgoal of any compatible people is romance, completely cuts out some of the most beautiful times you can have with people.	2
I've spent countless all-nighters with a friend just shooting shit, due to insomnia and boredom.	2
I've held a friend so close after she told me I was the biggest reason she hadn't killed herself.	2
I've watched stars fall on a hilltop so clear and beautiful as I called a friend a sister for the first time.	2
So many interactions.	2
So many beautiful, hard, wonderful, life-changing experiences I've had because of friendships with women.	2
because we seem to forget so many times that women are people too, they are sad, happy, lonely and joyful at times, just like us.	2
Sometimes you love a person without needing to hold them close to you.	2
Experience that, I beg you.	2

A lot of the times, yes, women and men do interact in a romantic way, one trying to impress the other to get involved in romance.	0

I've held a friend so close after she told me I was the biggest reason she hadn't killed herself.	0

Sometimes you love a person without needing to hold them close to you.	0
Experience that, I beg you.	0

	0
This is a great way to look at it. I come from this all-boy's school background, and I can't shake the feeling of loss when a male friend of mine gets together with a female friend.	0
I feel like I'm impinging on their relationship whenever I try to interact with the girl because I'm afraid that my male friend will think that there's some ulterior motive involved.	0
What all of you seem to be telling me so far is that the highest form of relationship doesn't have to be romantic, yet for some reason I wonder how you've make such good friends and been able to keep it fully platonic with all of them.	0
I hope that's not a bad thing to wonder--I just thought that if you get that close with someone, they might be for you.	0

FYI, you don't have to go to USHS to be a military doctor.	2
You can go to civilian medical school, and get HPSP which is slightly different but accomplishes roughly the same thing.	2
Well, it's not worth it for the money	2
. You'll lose money by taking HPSP and especially with USHS (a longer commitment than HPSP).	2
You'll owe the military tons of time for the training, so you won't be able to enter civilian practice for years.	2
Civilian neurosurgeons will easily catch up to their debtless peers in the military due to the huge difference in salaries.	2
A civilian neurosurgeon can make over 400k easily.	2
Neurosurgery is already competitive, and the military's neurosurgery residencies are extremely limited.	2
You may end up as a general surgeon, or doing several GMO tours before starting your 7 year neurosurgery residency.	2
If you're not all in with the military you'll hate being a military doctor.	2
The only reason to do HPSP or USHS is because you want to be a doctor in the military, not because you want the money.	2
If you're ambivalent the risk is too great.	2
Banks have zero problem giving out loans to medical students.	2
You'll easily cover your tuition, and while debt sucks you'll easily pay it off after residency.	2

The only reason to do HPSP or USHS is because you want to be a doctor in the military, not because you want the money.	0
If you're ambivalent the risk is too great.	0
>I'm also poor and medical school in the military (from what I understand) pays for smart kids.	0
Banks have zero problem giving out loans to medical students.	0
You'll easily cover your tuition, and while debt sucks you'll easily pay it off after residency.	0
In short, don't do it unless you are 100% committed to spending about a decade and a half in the military in a speciality that might not even necessarily be NSRGY	0
 That whipped me around real fast.	0
I guess it's more about being a military doctor rather than a doctor in the military.	0

One reason I take this stance is because the newly released games are ectremely similar to their predecessors.	2
There are few if any changes in gameplay, and the basic level design for the most part, remains the same.	2
Even Advanced Warfare, which seemed to promise the most novel changes, was criticized for changing too little from its preceding games.	2
Another reason for my opinion is that CoD doesn't really have anything astoundingly different from other games of the same genre.	2
There are a few unique features here and there, but overall, it's just another FPS with nothing spectacular that sets it above the other games in its genre.	2
With absolutely anything, there will always be things that people that aren't a fan of.	2
Make major changes and instead of Person A hating the series and Person B loving it, now Person A loves it and Person B hates it.	2
Consider the goal the creators of CoD have.	2
To make money.	2
And they consistently perform this goal well year after year.	2
Now, you're an executive of Activision-Blizzard.	2
Why would you tell the developers to do a complete 180 on the series, "for change's sake."?	2
You only run risk and very little reward.	2
If you stick to the tried and true model they've had, you're very nearly guaranteed to make a certain amount of sales. I'm sure they can graph the sales of each subsequent game and make predictions to the gradual decline with each passing year as more and more individuals grow bored of the CoD formula.	2
If they keep selling games, it means people still enjoy the series for what it is.	2
There are more people who still like the series and will buy new iterations without much change compared to the minority who do find it cliche, hackneyed, etc.	2
I mean, be realistic here, if they promised the most radically new CoD next year, would you buy it?	2
Probably not.	2
You have a bias against the series.	2
Why would their target audience be the people who *don't* like CoD?	2
It makes no sense.	2
Making an entirely new engine is costly, takes years to develop, and you never have a guarantee of financial success upon release.	2
It makes more sense to stick with the old engine and old code, which drastically reduces the time (and therefore cost) it takes to make a new game.	2
They aren't a charity, so gamers aren't entitled to it.	2
Many other game serie use a formulaic system for their games that renders them very similar to each other, such as Assassin's Creed, or Pokemon.	2
The thing about CoD that really makes it an overrated series is that it is very similar to other FPS games, such as Battlefield.	2
It was the first FPS to really popularize the RPG elements of progression and grow multiplayer FPS to the size that it is.	2
Halo may have been the first of its kind at the time, but CoD created a very effective system where you leveled up, unlocked new guns, and gave you customization in your load out.	2
When considering the first few CoDs, this was massive and largely is attributed to its success.	2
It turned multiplayer FPS from a niche genre to if not the largest genre.	2
Hell, consider Halo 4 that changed their fundamental mechanics to match more of a CoD pace and include load outs and level progression.	2
It's a large statement that such a dedicated fanbase Halo had moved toward the direction of CoD. Given CoD's immense popularity, everyone wanted to jump on the bandwagon of its success.	2
To view CoD as overrated for being the series that really grew the genre to what it is today would be to say WoW is overrated given how many MMOs are similar.	2
When you consider there were a select few MMOs before WoW that failed to mainstream and popularize the genre, and the immense number of WoW clones after its success, it's not fair to say WoW is overrated.	2
It's iconic in its genre.	2
CMV: The Call of Duty franchise is extremely overrated and overhyped.	1
I'd like to start off by saying that the CoD games are good games in their own right,	1
they are extremely overhyped	1
numbers don't lie.	1
Really, your view of "overrated and overhyped" is nothing more than an idiosyncratic reflection of your own *personal* threshold for formulaic video games.	1
But this view is separate from the objective success of the series.	1
The other major point is that video game development is extremely expensive.	1
Brand new engine CoDs likely wouldn't make sufficiently more money to offset their cost to make it.	1
And your explanation on why the series' games are extremely similar to each other is superb.	1
However, this in itself isn't why I think the games are overrated.	1
It really doesn't have any revolutionary groundbreaking features of its own,	1
each game feeds off the success of its predecessor.	1
One can argue some earlier games like Counterstrike did something similar much sooner, for some reason CoD popularized it.	1
Brought it to the mainstream.	1
It's not so much that CoD is similar to other FPS as other FPSs largely copied their model.	1
It's the copies and general state of the genre today that is overrated and hackneyed.	1
I feel that your view isn't so much feeling that CoD is overrated as it is that you feel multiplayer FPS is overrated.	1

I don't care if people post nudes, I'm just saying that this is how I feel when I see people posting nudes.	2
simply need because that's their personality and that they feed off of attention.	2
I don't understand how posting images of yourself naked, often with the understanding that others will masturbate to you (/r/gonewild for example) is not empowering but instead a form of whoring yourself out in a sense.	2
It depends on the person.	2
One person can be incredibly confident with his/her private parts.	2
Therefore, the person is eager to show off and get some attention.	2
However, most people are not quite as endowed or gifted as these attention-seekers.	2
It's an empowering feeling to be so comfortable with yourself (endowed or not) that you are proud to post nude photos.	2
The compliments feel great as well!	2
After all, most people choose to remain anonymous -so what attention are they really getting?	2
You're also forgetting the tremendous amount of sexual energy that factors into posting nude photos.	2
People enjoy browsing other's nude photos, so they decide to contribute some of their own.	2
It gives them pleasure to know that other people get pleasure by seeing the posted photos.	2
Again, this is more empowering than attention-seeking.	2
isn't that stool a form of attention seeking?	2
Being proud of something (which in the case of nudes, like breast size, is sometimes uncontrollable and not something that one has to work for to attain that pride) is different than showing it off.	2
I'm proud of my own genitals but I have no need to show them to anyone other than my girlfriend who I want to enjoy them.	2
The difference I see is between pride and attention seeking behavior caused by pride.	2
Of course, for those in relationships or some kind of monogamous partnership, I understand the sexual energy between sharing and receiving sexual images between each other.	2
In the example of the monogamous partnership, I do not consider that type of behavior as being attention seeking or anything because it is meant to be between the two individuals for their own mutual sexual pleasure.	2
Nudes end up all over the internet and going into that situation,	2
In anticipating this inevitability, aren't they then giving away they're nudes essentially for anyone to recurve sexual pleasure from?	2
what they get in return is the gratification of strangers admitting their nudity without the mutual respect in return.	2
I don't see it as one wanting to gain some type of status from it attached to themselves, but instead the gratification of having others pleasure themselves to their nudity.	2
For example, internet trolls work on the basis of causing as much fuss and attention as possible while often remaining anonymous.	2
They are not trying to get attention toward themselves superficially, but they're instead attention seeking to just get the attention of others.	2
Do you do this to seek attention from her?	2
Or do you do it because it is empowering?	2
It makes you feel good when she tells you how impressed she is with your junk and when she gets pleasure from it.	2
Other people don't have partners to do this with so they resort to the internet.	2
Some people even have partners and still do it.	2
It's a thrill and a risk that gives people immense pleasure.	2
They are not getting any attention though, since they usually remain anonymous.	2
Also, when it is spread online you hardly ever find out who has seen it or what people think of it.	2
Therefore, you may never be able to recognize the attention you get.	2
Just the act of posting the photo is enough to drive some people wild, whether 1 person sees it or 1,000.	2
Like I've said, isn't the garnering of any attention on the internet from your nudes photos still seeking the attention of others?	2
It doesn't matter how many strangers see it, just the fact that they are strangers.	2
I think the anonymity of the internet allows people to freely get the attention without worrying about the recognition or views of friends and family, so they're purposely looking for attention they can't find within their immediate relationships.	2
Just because you don't find it empowering to post nudes, doesn't mean other people won't.	2
It's impossible to assert that everyone who has posted nudes does it strictly for attention.	2
Of course, I have no issue with sexting, considering I do it often,	2
Just as I don't necessarily understand the joy of exhibitionism, exhibitionists don't understand how I *don't* find joy from it.	2
Since I am so unaccustomed to it and do not partake in it, I can't make an uninformed judgement about it.	2
I am not going to tell that person that he/she is doing it for attention - because frankly - I have no clue why exactly the person does it (the person may not even know either)!	2
CMV: Posting nude pictures online is caused by a need for attention and not empowering	1
I am not saying that people are not allowed to do what they like.	1
Also, I don't mean to suggest that there is anything wrong with posting nudes.	1
Lastly, I have nothing wrong with nudity and am in fact a fan of nudity, I just don't understand exposing yourself to the entirety of the internet on a whim.	1
Whenever I see anyone, male or female, posting nude pictures on the internet, I immediately assume that they are somehow seeking attention.	1
Of course, that's the point, but I think that it must stem from some underlying need to get attention that they must either be lacking in some other part of their life	1
In this sense, it is not done for attention.	1
I agree that people enjoy showing off	1
You so make a good point about the sexual energy.	1
The difference between that scenario (which I think most people can agree with) and posting nudes online is that often someone will post an image and an unknown amount of people may see it and get pleasure from it.	1
I see that behavior as attention seeking	1
I want to show them to my girlfriend because I know that it makes her think of our sexual activities and I'm trying to make her think about that to remind her off how it feels good physically and to be close with her in a sexual way	1
I don't do it to bring attention to myself, but rather to our relationship.	1
This is much different from posting a photo that a tension stranger will masturbate to.	1
You do it because you get pleasure from your girlfriend being into you and your sexual relationship.	1
This is empowering, not attention seeking.	1
Other people do it because they get pleasure from strangers masturbating to it.	1
This is empowering, not attention seeking.	1
I can guarantee you I was not trying to get attention from these girls, and nor was I trying to make them think of our sexual activities or remind them of sex (impossible since I didn't live near them).	1
I enjoyed their compliments, knowing that they received pleasure, and seeing their photos as well.	1
Sexting is an entirely separate entity that has it's own set of motivations.	1
I just don't understand that you're of behavior and since I have never partaken in it I just can't grasp it.	1
The trouble I have is that I don't get a good enough perspective from those that do post nudes online.	1
You're right about the sexting thing	1
the fine line ice drawn is hard to find and relatively ambiguous.	1
so I guess in that sense I can sort of understand the stance one would receive from posting nudes.	1
Thats very true .	1
Applying it to my own life and what I personally do is a good way to assess not only this situation, but any situation in general.	1

Specifically in the case with women, many of my female friends, including my girlfriend (hence the throwaway) , have posted nudes and any time I ask them why, they somehow defend it with "it makes me feel good."	0
Of course, I ask them why it makes them feel good and most either don't have an answer or somehow deay it makes them feel empowered as a woman who is proud of her body.	0
I don't understand how posting images of yourself naked, often with the understanding that others will masturbate to you (/r/gonewild for example) is not empowering but instead a form of whoring yourself out in a sense.	0

simply need because that's their personality and that they feed off of attention.	2
I don't understand how posting images of yourself naked, often with the understanding that others will masturbate to you (/r/gonewild for example) is not empowering but instead a form of whoring yourself out in a sense.	2
If someone is confident in their body, is it not empowering to have other people give you reassurance of that position?	2
The definition of empowering is to "make (someone) stronger and more confident".	2
If the feedback about their bodies does that, then so be it.	2
People seem to get very morally judgmental about how the internet has made us all so much more open.	2
We share so much and censor so much less... but why is this necessarily a bad thing?	2
If  no harm is done, what problem is there in using the internet for such exchange?	2
Like it or not, the platforms websites have provided have made a level playing field for anyone to find some kind of minor 'celebrity', with a paparazzi of their anonymous peers.	2
If the attrition of that kind of fan base is what empowers her, so be it.	2
It may be complex for those in relationships who want more exclusivity, but that's more an interpersonal problem than a denial of empowerment.	2
There are plenty of other ways to garner positive attention that everyone can agree is positive, instead of morally questionable behavior.	2
Also, why is gaining a celebrity status for something like posting nudes empowering?	2
What about that makes someone feel good?	2
Also, I think that some of my problem is, like you said, the fine line I have drawn.	2
The lines I tend to draw in life are ambiguous and hard to support which often results in a weak basis for my opinions.	2
Hence, my seeking of others opinions.	2
Let us not forget that during the Renaissance there was a huge movement for the exploration of the human form as a work of art.	2
Much of the surviving ancient sculptures and paintings show the nakedness of the human form, and this art compares us to heroes and gods as did much of the writing and philosophy of the time as we tried to figure out our "meaning" in the universe.	2
What makes modern sexuality morally abhorrent?	2
What logical basis is there for the rejection of the human form and the demonizing those who are open about their sexual identity?	2
Slut shaming, or as you did, calling it as "whoring"?	2
the basis of that has been our periodic pushes from the church, periods of "Great Awakening" where fundamentalists have tried to restore us to some kind of repressive god-fearing and internalized state of self loathing and cleansing for sin.	2
In fact if you look towards Europe, a lot of their media is much more lenient on sex than violence, whereas over here we're more lenient on violence than sex.	2
The only ways I can think of are people trying to go back and find those pictures and use them against a person as some kind of ad-hominem attack in the public.	2
Even you've admitted you can't really articulate it you just feel this way because you *just do*. Which is no basis for a logical or reasonable way to think about the world.	2

Also, I don't mean to suggest that there is anything wrong with posting nudes.	1
Lastly, I have nothing wrong with nudity and am in fact a fan of nudity, I just don't understand exposing yourself to the entirety of the internet on a whim.	1
Whenever I see anyone, male or female, posting nude pictures on the internet, I immediately assume that they are somehow seeking attention.	1
Of course, that's the point, but I think that it must stem from some underlying need to get attention that they must either be lacking in some other part of their life	1
What you're really seeming to say is that any action which garners attention is morally corrupt.	1
You've drawn this fine line where something that is done for attention cannot also be done for empowerment, which I find to be the crux of your dilemma.	1
I personally am against the openness that society has taken with the internet	1
.	1
I think that this openness is not detrimental per se, but is just a display of someone's character.	1
Like I said, I have no*problem* with anyone posting nudes,	1
I just immediately view them differently as one seeking attention.	1
When I see that type of situation I see someone who knowingly is attractive, considering they have a high status, and is willing to sexually pleasure their followers via this attractiveness that they already know they have.	1
I as a person have a hard time seeing through other people's eyes if I can't justify a logical reason to do it.	1
I just don't see any reason in this type of behavior.	1
. And yet this is just the interplay of societal values.	1
Now of course, this is a romantic view of history which takes the surviving works of outstanding people, rather than looking towards the common man...	1
certainly that is a point to be made about the modern time as well.	1
Certainly in America there is a huge bias against such things,	1
Beyond some shell of spirituality, there is no real objective reasoning to be so opposed to sex.	1
This again, though, goes back to a culture which seems unreasonably biased towards sex.	1
There's this mystique and taboos surrounding it's open discussion which involve shaming and peer pressure, bullying and non-sense.	1
CMV: Posting nude pictures online is caused by a need for attention and not empowering	0
http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2qmhw7/cmv_posting_nude_pictures_online_is_caused_by_a/	0
Let me make this clear before I continue, I am not saying that people are not allowed to do what they like.	0
I don't care if people post nudes, I'm just saying that this is how I feel when I see people posting nudes.	0
Also, I don't mean to suggest that there is anything wrong with posting nudes.	0
Lastly, I have nothing wrong with nudity and am in fact a fan of nudity, I just don't understand exposing yourself to the entirety of the internet on a whim.	0
Whenever I see anyone, male or female, posting nude pictures on the internet, I immediately assume that they are somehow seeking attention.	0
Of course, that's the point, but I think that it must stem from some underlying need to get attention that they must either be lacking in some other part of their life, or simply need because that's their personality and that they feed off of attention.	0
Specifically in the case with women, many of my female friends, including my girlfriend (hence the throwaway) , have posted nudes and any time I ask them why, they somehow defend it with "it makes me feel good."	0
Of course, I ask them why it makes them feel good and most either don't have an answer or somehow deay it makes them feel empowered as a woman who is proud of her body.	0
I don't understand how posting images of yourself naked, often with the understanding that others will masturbate to you (/r/gonewild for example) is not empowering but instead a form of whoring yourself out in a sense.	0
So reddit, why do people post nudes? I seriously can't grasp the concept in a way that justifies this action, and have come into conflict with female friends and my gf and would like to be able to see this from another angle.	0
Thanks in advance.	0
EDIT:  Thank you for all of the replies!  You guys pointed out some clearly fallacious opinions I had and also showed me a multitude of other views on the issue.  This is a very personal issue that only pertains to my own beliefs and not something I go around spouting to others.  This was a good learning experience for myself, so again thank you all.  I have deltas to those I felt really stuck with the discussion, but I'd like to thank you all for commenting.	0
What you're really seeming to say is that any action which garners attention is morally corrupt.	0
You've drawn this fine line where something that is done for attention cannot also be done for empowerment, which I find to be the crux of your dilemma.	0
If someone is confident in their body, is it not empowering to have other people give you reassurance of that position?	0
The definition of empowering is to "make (someone) stronger and more confident".	0
If the feedback about their bodies does that, then so be it.	0
People seem to get very morally judgmental about how the internet has made us all so much more open.	0
We share so much and censor so much less... but why is this necessarily a bad thing?	0
If  no harm is done, what problem is there in using the internet for such exchange?	0
Like it or not, the platforms websites have provided have made a level playing field for anyone to find some kind of minor 'celebrity', with a paparazzi of their anonymous peers.	0
If the attrition of that kind of fan base is what empowers her, so be it.	0
It may be complex for those in relationships who want more exclusivity, but that's more an interpersonal problem than a denial of empowerment.	0
I personally am against the openness that society has taken with the internet	0
. I do not participate in most social media besides reddit, and even then I mostly lurk.	0
Regardless, I think that this openness is not detrimental per se, but is just a display of someone's character.	0
Like I said, I have no*problem* with anyone posting nudes, I just immediately view them differently as one seeking attention.	0
There are plenty of other ways to garner positive attention that everyone can agree is positive, instead of morally questionable behavior.	0
Of course no harm is done, but often this type of behavior CAN come back to haunt the original poster in a number of ways.	0
Also, why is gaining a celebrity status for something like posting nudes empowering?	0
What about that makes someone feel good?	0
When I see that type of situation I see someone who knowingly is attractive, considering they have a high status, and is willing to sexually pleasure their followers via this attractiveness that they already know they have.	0
I understand that a lot of the issues I raise are personal opinions not shared by others which is why I asked in the first place.	0
I as a person have a hard time seeing through other people's eyes if I can't justify a logical reason to do it.	0
I just don't see any reason in this type of behavior.	0
Also, I think that some of my problem is, like you said, the fine line I have drawn.	0
The lines I tend to draw in life are ambiguous and hard to support which often results in a weak basis for my opinions.	0
Hence, my seeking of others opinions.	0
Thanks for your reply.	0
> There are plenty of other ways to garner positive attention that everyone can agree is positive, instead of morally questionable behavior.	0
. And yet this is just the interplay of societal values.	0
Let us not forget that during the Renaissance there was a huge movement for the exploration of the human form as a work of art.	0
Much of the surviving ancient sculptures and paintings show the nakedness of the human form, and this art compares us to heroes and gods as did much of the writing and philosophy of the time as we tried to figure out our "meaning" in the universe.	0
Now of course, this is a romantic view of history which takes the surviving works of outstanding people, rather than looking towards the common man... but	0
certainly that is a point to be made about the modern time as well.	0
What makes modern sexuality morally abhorrent?	0
What logical basis is there for the rejection of the human form and the demonizing those who are open about their sexual identity?	0
Slut shaming, or as you did, calling it as "whoring"?	0
Certainly in America there is a huge bias against such things, but the basis of that has been our periodic pushes from the church, periods of "Great Awakening" where fundamentalists have tried to restore us to some kind of repressive god-fearing and internalized state of self loathing and cleansing for sin.	0
Beyond some shell of spirituality, there is no real objective reasoning to be so opposed to sex.	0
In fact if you look towards Europe, a lot of their media is much more lenient on sex than violence, whereas over here we're more lenient on violence than sex.	0
> Of course no harm is done, but often this type of behavior CAN come back to haunt the original poster in a number of ways.	0
The only ways I can think of are people trying to go back and find those pictures and use them against a person as some kind of ad-hominem attack in the public.	0
This again, though, goes back to a culture which seems unreasonably biased towards sex.	0
There's this mystique and taboos surrounding it's open discussion which involve shaming and peer pressure, bullying and non-sense.	0
Why?	0
Even you've admitted you can't really articulate it you just feel this way because you *just do*. Which is no basis for a logical or reasonable way to think about the world.	0
Thanks for your replies. I learned a lot from this thread, and specifically from your comments.	0
Thanks again 	0
A "standard" hiring method would ensure that every applicant would be evaluated on the same criteria - the satisfaction of requirements of the position  merits relevant to that position.	2
Who an applicant knows is occasionally useful for those jobs which require maintaining relationships with certain people in key positions (e.g. sales), but for the vast majority of jobs, who your friends are is functionally irrelevant.	2
Allowing someone to circumvent the standard application process ("jumping the line") or to use some important person's recommendation as additional clout for their application ("came very highly recommended by Bob") is preferential treatment for irrelevant qualities.	2
This is a failing of the existing job application paradigm, not an excuse to circumvent it in order to make the process easier.	2
Beyond straight nepotism, it is self-evident that individuals who come from families  backgrounds which allow for more interaction with individuals in power will be able to call on more of those individuals for networking purposes.	2
Individuals who are extraordinarily qualified for a position but come from a region/social background without those connections enter a networking-friendly employment opportunity at a disadvantage.	2
Allowing networking to influence a hiring decision is not dependent on cultural bias  may be safely exorcised from the hiring process to render it more fair	2
This decreases social/economic mobility, which has been demonstrated to be bad for societies in general.	2
If the egalitarian hiring process in-place is so ineffective at determining qualifications/character that it must depend on recommendations from trusted sources to establish merit, the productivity of any positions where such a trusted source does not come forward will suffer.	2
"Fix the process, not the game."	2
Businesses are and should be designed to be effective.	2
Being fair is, at best, a secondary goal.	2
Any company/society which encourages business practices that are not effective will quickly be out-competed by one that is effective, and having effective businesses in a society in general improves the quality of life of the people living there.	2
Simply getting an employee in the door often costs about 1 years worth of their salary, with that money going to the recruiters that found the person, paying people to review their resume, interview them, do background checks, etc.	2
Then, after they start working, they have to be trained, and get up to speed on their new job, which (depending on the job) can often take months.	2
If all of this time and money goes towards a bad hire, that is an extremely bad thing for the business, which means that it's extremely important to minimize the number of bad hires.	2
Interviews are an extremely poor replacement actually working with someone, or for the opinion of a trusted colleague.	2
CMV: Networking for jobs behaves as a discriminatory mechanism to keep money  good jobs inside a particular social circle,  should be discouraged or eliminated as a criterion for employment.	1
Networking is discriminatory.	1
I recognize  appreciate that it is difficult in most employment processes to find individuals who are trustworthy, socially apt, etc.	1
Networking, as a practice, favors individuals who come from already socially favorable situations, moreso than other evaluation criteria.	1
there are other unfair advantages an applicant might have (being tall, white, male, etc.).	1
Businesses  societies would be better off disallowing networking from influencing their hiring decisions.	1
If a hiring process takes networking into account, it is necessarily showing preference to individuals who already come from advantaged background, as per 2.	1
"this is how the world works," and many feel at ease participating in networking events without any moral qualms	1
I'm not going to challenge your view that networking is unfair, because it totally is.	1
But I am going to challenge your view that it should be discouraged or eliminated.	1
There are some exceptions, that justify regulation, such as environmental or fraud protection,	1
I don't think networking is one of them,	1
The best way to do that is to hire people you've worked with before, and you know are good, or people your colleagues and friends have worked with before, who you trust when they say that someone is good.	1
Totally valid game theory, and well-articulated!	1

I'm a software engineer with an idea for a start up.	2
But being an engineer, I just want to focus on the technology.	2
I need someone to handle running the business side of things.	2
I've got a friend I've worked with for years.	2
Our different skills complement each other nicely, we have well established channels of communication, and I know she'll be a great business manager or my start up.	2
Do I need to post an opening and go through a standard process, or can I enlist my friend?	2
Six months into our start up, I can't handle the engineering work alone.	2
My background is software, and there's a hardware component that needs an experienced circuit designer.	2
I know a guy who eats, sleeps, and breathes circuit design.	2
We worked on several projects together in college, and I know I can trust him to get the job done quickly and do high quality work.	2
Do I need to post an opening and go through a standard process, or can I hire my old classmate?	2
Now we're looking to crowd fund the mass production of our product, and we need a good video for Kickstarter.	2
My co-founder's neighbor does video for an advertising firm, and we've looked around enough to know that they've offered us a competitive rate.	2
Do we need to shop more of the market, or can we use my co-founder's neighbor?	2
As mass production kicks off, I put the circuit designer in charge of QA/QC for the produced units.	2
He can't test enough units on his own.	2
He could use an extra hand, but feels making a bad hire would be worse than doing it all himself.	2
He's got an old colleague that is experienced in hardware QA/QC, and happens to be available for six months.	2
Can we hire the colleague who is a known quantity, or should we just punt on hiring anyone because it would be faster for the circuit designer to do it himself than go through a rigorous hiring process?	2
At what point do your rules against networking kick in?	2
I don't think anyone would seriously suggest that someone looking to found a start up should have to dig through a pile of applicants to choose a co-founder.	2
I would also hope that a start up's first technical hire could be someone the founders have a reason to trust.	2
And I see a line manager growing his team as a microcosm of a founder growing his company, though the company may have rules in place to help keep the line managers from going off the reservation.	2
Do your rules only apply to big companies?	2
If so, how big are we talking?	2
Finally, do you apply the same rules to hiring out business services?	2
When we hired that advertising company to make our Kickstarter video, were we breaking the networking rules?	2

The animation is very solid for being made in the 1980`s and I absolutely love the inanimate objects journey to try and find their master.	2
One very tense scene for me was when the vacuum cleaner was trying to cross the canyon.	2
The Brave Little Toaster is rated "Fresh" on Rotten Tomatoes, and came fairly close to winning the Sundance Film Festival in 1987.	2
The movie was not widely released in theaters because they never found a distributor for it.	2
So most of us who saw it did so in comparatively limited TV showings, or picked up a VHS tape.	2
It wasn't a made for TV movie, but that's what ended up happening to it.	2
It has massively outsized footprint for how easy it is to find and view.	2
Those who worked on it went on to do great things, and those who stumbled across it remember it.	2
but it is obscure and can be a hard sell because key elements haven't aged well.	2
CMV: I believe the Brave Little Toaster is an incredibly underrated movie	1
Ive seen a lot of animated movies in my life but in my opinion they dont stand up to the Brave Little Toaster.	1
I feel like this masterpiece is largely unappreciated by a majority of people in favor of other animated movies.	1
Reddit I think the Brave Little Toaster needs some more attention and some more love.	1
The reason it is doesn't have attention now is because it didn't get attention back in the day.	1

Holy Crap I never knew it only went straight to VHS.	0
That does explain a lot which kinda makes me sad it never got the loving from a massive portion of people like Iron Giant.	0

Neither things are as cool as fighting Russians out of a moral sense of duty, but they're far more effective.	2
You should not underestimate how threatened Russia feels by the West's expansion into what used to be a buffer zone.	2

Not everybody will make enough that his financial support will outweigh the military support he can provide, this is a definite nuance to my general initial statement though.	2
Supporting foreign militaries financially also has proven sketchy at best in the past, because it's hard to control where the weapons eventually end up.	2

His territorial pissings seems to be meant to elbow some room for himself on the geopolitical stage, in other words gaining power.	1
Putin is a totalitarian, oppressive, ruthless man, and allowing him to gain more power will affect all of us.	1
I doubt anyone on the Ukrainian front actually wants a bunch of untrained Europeans to show up and start attacking anything that looks vaguely Russian.	1
If you really want to help, sending money you earn with something you're actually good at (your job) is far more helpful.	1
Another thing you can do is to tell your government to send (military) aid.	1
The above assumes that the Europeans should get more involved with the Ukrainian conflict.	1
While I agree that that might be the moral thing to do,	1
we should be very careful not to escalate the conflict.	1

[47% of all jobs are at risk of being automated](http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/the-rich-and-their-robots-are-about-to-make-half-the-worlds-jobs-disappear).	2
This number will grow grow until the vast majority of people become obsolete for jobs.	2
Since some of this automation will inevitably come to weapons, the wealthy will have the perfect opportunity to commit genocide on the 99%.	2
By fortifying themselves in their gated communities with rows upon rows of automated defences, all unburdened by humans with consciences and families, they can simply wait for everyone to starve or get killed while they bask in their machine generated wealth.	2
Once everyone is dead, they can simply be wiped from history.	2
You, me, everyone will have never existed.	2
A crime completely erased.	2
Throughout history, people tend to use their wealth to show off how much wealth they have.	2
The status symbols change over time, but the existence of status symbols doesn't.	2
There was a time, say in the 18th century, where the elite would wear quite elaborate clothing.	2
Check out this picture of [Louis XIV](http://www.paradoxplace.com/Photo%20Pages/France/France_History/Images/Louis-XIV-BAR800.jpg).	2
He's dressing in elaborate, fantastical clothing to tell everyone, "look how rich and powerful I am.	2
I can afford to waste resources on immense amounts of expensive fabric."	2
Nowadays, you would never see a wealthy leader dressing like this.	2
Clothes have become cheap, thus they are no longer useful as a status symbol.	2
Certain elite brands are used to show off wealth, but the suit the president wears is little different in form than the suit you can buy down at Walmart.	2
His suit is just higher quality and better fitted.	2
Or consider beauty standards.	2
Back during the Victorian Era, it was very fashionable for women of class to have extremely pale skin.	2
When most of the populace lived on farms or walked to work in a factory, most people got tan quite easily.	2
Only the rich could afford to be pale.	2
Nowadays, where most people work office jobs, retail jobs, food service, etc, tanning is a luxury good, a sign you have enough spare time to sit in the sun or money to go to a tanning salon.	2
So, what would the luxury goods be for a post-scarcity society?	2
In such a society, the cost of most physical goods would approach zero.	2
Raw materials would be extracted by robots.	2
Energy would come from cheap robot-produced solar farms.	2
Robots would assemble and repair other robots.	2
The cost of most physical goods, in a true post-scarcity society, is near zero.	2
Sure, a common laborer could buy a thousand copies of a 2015 Lexus, but what's the point?	2
Even someone working at Burger King could afford to put together a copy of Louis XIV's outfit, but no one ever does.	2
It's just seen as silly and ridiculous, possibly even a sign of mental illness.	2
So, what would rich people spend their money on?	2
What are the status goods of post-scarcity society?	2
Well, real estate could certainly be one.	2
The cost to build a house may be zero, but land certainly isn't.	2
Still, this can be ameliorated by high-rises.	2
Lots of people can afford to live in a ritzy downtown area if a high-quality high rise can be built to next for nothing.	2
Owning a single-family home in a high-quality area would be a status symbol, but just living their wouldn't.	2
So, without that, what do we have?	2
About the only thing you can buy with your money at that point is human-intensive services.	2
Sure, you *could* use a robot to clean your house, but do you want people to think you are poor?	2
Show off your wealth by hiring a butler instead.	2
You *could* put your kid through a MOOC to teach them algebra, but you're better than that.	2
Hire an expensive private tutor instead.	2
You *could* have a robot do your hair or nails, but really?	2
What are you, a common peasant?	2
Pay for the fancy salon instead and show off your fabulous wealth.	2
You *could* use a driverless car, but having someone drive you around is just so much more classy.	2
CMV: Progress in automation will eventually lead to a full fledge genocide on the majority of the population.	1

I'm Unitarian Universalist	2
Had a group of religions identical in all respects to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam developed in pretty much any area other than the middle east, they would be no more successful than any of the other relatively minor faiths out there today, depending on what the location in question actually was	2
Whatever other religion had ended up developing in the middle east would likely now be globally dominant	2
a large part of this view came from something a history teacher told me 6 years ago: "Geography Determines Destiny", and that quote has stuck with me	2
Christianity was primarily spread by the Roman empire	2
But Rome already had a state religion before it adopted Christianity	2
Likewise, Islam was hardly the first religion that Arabia had seen	2
If Islam had arisen amongst the Moriori instead of in Arabia, I suspect we'd have a largely Christian world	2
I can't imagine missionaries travelling out of New Zealand having the same impact that the Arab armies did	2
For most religions, it matters what you do	2
When pagan Vikings met Christians, they knew the Christian warriors would end up in Valhalla or somewhere Christianly equivalent	2
Why would Thor reject a valiant warrior just because he didn't worship him?	2
It seems like a compromise but the eventual outcome is that the belief wins and the practices may or may not stick	2
You might be a Christian that acts like a Roman, but the word is Christian and the idols eventually disappear while the Bible sticks around	2
Note that this is to a large extent what happened with the Native Americans	2
It's not just that the Christians defeated the tribes militarily (though that happened sometimes)	2
It's more that the Christians would come to the tribes, adopt their ways, offer them good things like education, and all they'd want is a little Bible reading	2
Well the native faiths don't think reading the Bible is against their religion - they didn't emphasize belief the way Christians and Muslims do	2
To a large extent, Judaism/Christianity/Islam were religions that demanded literacy	2
This meant the teachers were also religious teachers	2
Compare this to China, where literacy wasn't tied to religion	2
There may have been better literacy in China, but the smartest people (or most avid readers anyway) weren't necessarily going into religion	2
Christianity was one of a very small number of religions that claim a duty to proselytize and convert everyone	2
Most religions, confronted with a different religion, just say "this is true here and that's true there" or "those are some deities we hadn't known about" or at worst "those are some deities that are not ours"	2
Christianity really goes for the "this is true for everyone for always, and we should actively work to spread it"	2
If Alexander the Great had that kind of religious zealotry, he could have spread Hellenism much more than he did	2
he was satisfied with just adding himself to whatever pantheon the locals worshipped	2
CMV: The global dominance of the abrahamic faiths is largely an accident of geography	1
it seems that the core of the success of the Abrahamic religions is dependent largely on the middle east's nature as both a major trade hub between Africa, Europe, and the rest of Asia	1
and on the fertile crescent's comparatively ancient status as a settled region	1
So the victory of Christianity over the Roman version of Hellenism can't be attributed to geography alone	1
Its dominance there was not mere geography	1
I'm definitely intrigued by this, but not quite convinced enough to delta	1
I might be able to go to "The religion eventually adopted by the Roman empire had a very good chance of becoming globally dominant"	1
I think that's still largely an accident of geography	1
your post definitely didn't address my point A) about a hypothetical identical religion in a different location	1
Geography certainly has to be part of it	1
you can't blame geography for which religion became pre-eminent in Rome	1
The emphasis on belief rather than practice	1
Education	1
A whole lot of history is actually just individuals doing idiosyncratic things	1
The right person in the right place at the right time	1
Universalism	1
Well, you have successfully moved me from "it's probably about 80% geography" to "it's probably 40-60% geography"	1
I think that's enough for a , so have one	1

EDIT: Here it is:  Merry Christmas	0
As the story goes, when Jesus was about to be born his parents were travelling to Bethlehem, but when they got there the inn was full, so Mary had to give birth in the barn	2
The problem is, if nativity scenes are any indication, baby Jesus was still in the manger when the three wise men came to visit and give him Christmas presents	2
Most people know Jesus was born on Christmas, but less realize that the wise men didn't show up until the Epiphany twelve days later	2
Because that would be the most unbelievable aspect of the entire story if you ask me	2
it seriously strains credulity to begin with	2
Even miracles make more sense in the context of the birth of the Son of God	2
Maybe a virgin really could give birth to a deity, or a new star could magically appear over the birthplace	2
there's no reason for the inn to miraculously have no rooms come open for nearly two weeks	2
Plus Mary and Joseph would be the first to know when something came available since they were basically squatting in the garage and would surely notice when patrons came to get their ox or camel or whatever before leaving	2
Joseph probably would have made that barn the family's permanent rent-free residence if the wise men hadn't showed up bearing enough cash and prizes to go live it up in Egypt	2
why did they stay so long anyway?	2
It's not like Mary needed the time to recuperate	2
Thanks to baby Jesus' healing powers even her hymen immediately regenerated, kind of like the redhead vampire from True Blood or the cheerleader from Heroes	2
Not the real life Hayden Panettiere though, you know those gigantic Klitschkos split that wide open.	2
It wasn't a hotel that didn't have room for them	2
It was that extended family didn't have a guest room for Joseph's family	2
perhaps because of the scandalous nature of Mary's pregnancy?	2
CMV: Nativity scenes are antisemitic.	1
This has nothing to do with the celebration of Christmas excluding religious minorities	1
traditional nativity scenes reinforce negative stereotypes about Jews	1
Are we honestly expected to believe that no vacancies opened up at the inn for almost two weeks?	1
The obvious implication is that Jesus' chintzy Jewish stepdad was such a tightwad that he was willing to let his pubescent wife and her newborn baby sleep in donkey slop if it would save him a few shekels	1
Actually, most commentators think they didn't show up for a year or two	1
"inn" is arguably a poor translation	1
Them being stuck in a barn has nothing to do with Joseph being cheap and everything to do with his family having poor hospitality	1
Interesting, I was not aware of this perspective	1
certainly a lot can be lost in translation, especially multiple translations over centuries	1

As the story goes, when Jesus was about to be born his parents were travelling to Bethlehem, but when they got there the inn was full, so Mary had to give birth in the barn.	0
The problem is, if nativity scenes are any indication, baby Jesus was still in the manger when the three wise men came to visit and give him Christmas presents.	0
Most people know Jesus was born on Christmas, but less realize that the wise men didn't show up until the Epiphany twelve days later.	0
Are we honestly expected to believe that no vacancies opened up at the inn for almost two weeks? Because that would be the most unbelievable aspect of the entire story if you ask me, and it seriously strains credulity to begin with.	0
Even miracles make more sense in the context of the birth of the Son of God.	0
Maybe a virgin really could give birth to a deity, or a new star could magically appear over the birthplace, but there's no reason for the inn to miraculously have no rooms come open for nearly two weeks.	0
Plus Mary and Joseph would be the first to know when something came available since they were basically squatting in the garage and would surely notice when patrons came to get their ox or camel or whatever before leaving.	0
The obvious implication is that Jesus' chintzy Jewish stepdad was such a tightwad that he was willing to let his pubescent wife and her newborn baby sleep in donkey slop if it would save him a few shekels.	0
Joseph probably would have made that barn the family's permanent rent-free residence if the wise men hadn't showed up bearing enough cash and prizes to go live it up in Egypt.	0
After all, why did they stay so long anyway?	0
It's not like Mary needed the time to recuperate.	0
Thanks to baby Jesus' healing powers even her hymen immediately regenerated, kind of like the redhead vampire from True Blood or the cheerleader from Heroes.	0
(Not the real life Hayden Panettiere though, you know those gigantic Klitschkos split that wide open.)	0
MERRY CHRISTMAS!	0
Actually, most commentators think they didn't show up for a year or two.	0
Also, "inn" is arguably a poor translation.	0
It wasn't a hotel that didn't have room for them.	0
It was that extended family didn't have a guest room for Joseph's family (perhaps because of the scandalous nature of Mary's pregnancy?).	0
Them being stuck in a barn has nothing to do with Joseph being cheap and everything to do with his family having poor hospitality.	0
 Interesting, I was not aware of this perspective, and certainly a lot can be lost in translation, especially multiple translations over centuries.	0

Traditionally, in medieval Christian art, there is no consideration of time.	0
In other words, events that happen at different points in the narrative are depicted as occuring side-by-side without consideration for *when* and *where* they actually happened.	0
For instance, Jesus might be depicted as both a child and an adult in the same image.	0
One of the reasons the Italian Renaissance was, well, a *renaissance* was because its painters and artists began presenting things in a more realistic way, like how we might now think of as like a photograph: a specific moment frozen in time.	0

It's either the extreme left, or the extreme right.	2
Radicalism almost always leads to violence, and is a plague on democratic society and governments.	2
Since communism has been relegated to just a handful of countries	2
Often it is the leaders of such movements that prey on the weak-willed, using them as pawns in their ambitions of power.	2
Unfortunately with the world's obsession with free speech and personal liberty	2
Wouldn't restricting "free speech" put brakes on this sort of recruitment ?	2
Political parties in democracies often try to keep these groups on a leash	2
do not wish to eliminate them since they serve definite political goals like polarizing the electorate	2
Fear of losing votes from radical sympathizers leads to political groups appeasing extremism.	2
After the horrors of World War 2	2
their will always be a few bad apples	2
Instead, we allow them to spread their rot, and infect society.	2
The supports necessary for real stability simply don't exist.	2
Censorship is an extreme reaction to an extreme force	2
There are many things we used to consider extreme that are now fundamental principles of our society.	2
We claim that our old positions were wrong, and have good evidence to back this up.	2
With this in mind, we are forced to acknowledge that we are probably making errors in other places, and may even have been led astray in one of the areas we have already changed.	2
Censorship halts this process and locks in whatever is current.	2
Censorship does not eliminate the censored individual.	2
Indeed, they will work hard to evade the censor, carrying out their activities further from the public eye.	2
This brings their arguments out of public discourse, where a solid counter-argument is more likely to be interjected.	2
It also dooms any attempt to change their beliefs, as their opponents no longer understand those beliefs sufficiently to do this.	2
Finally it gives them a true claim that they are being oppressed and targeted, which history suggests tends to strengthen a group.	2
While this may be true, hasn't the killing of innocents (and murder or rape, or destruction of property) always been considered deeply immoral (outside of wars) ?	2
We already clamp down on extremism, and potential extremists are actively monitored using existing surveillance techniques.	2
Is it really that bad to go after them just a little bit more ?	2
CMV: Most democracies are far too tolerant of extremism, especially the likes of neo-fascism, neo-nazism, radical Islamism and violent intolerance.	1
The world has been to soft on these ideologies and they need to be eliminated whenever they appear.	1
I think some of the biggest threats to global stability comes from the political fringes.	1
the far-left has for the most part been dealt with	1
However the far-right continues to be a menace.	1
I believe fascist neo-nazi groups, the KKK, the golden dawn or any religious extremist group like radical Islamism all fall under the far-right.	1
These groups are always extreme fringes	1
a handful of people make the world a much nastier place	1
such leaders are given a free hand	1
I see this as a major flaw in democracy.	1
I think governments should do much more and try to completely stamp out any signs of fascism	1
I find it completely absurd that we still put up with their ideologies	1
Bringing socio-economic growth to communities that feel disenfranchised just isn't enough	1
These bad apples need to be weeded out	1
The only constant is change.	1
Global stability is a myth grown out of a population that has gotten good at balancing acts.	1
To carry out a balancing act, you have to avoid any extreme reactions, as they only make for larger oscillations.	1
Good arguments	1
Although I may disagree somewhat, I see why censorship can be dangerous.	1
don't you think it's a problem that the likes of ISIS some neo-nazi groups actively recruit on twitter and facebook	1
Should't this sort of thing be stopped ?	1

Instead, we allow them to spread their rot, and infect society.	2
Young impressionable minds are the easiest targets for zionist indoctrination.	2
it has become far too easy to recruit people into the zionist movement	2
When facebook and twitter is used to recruit zionist supporters and other jewish terrorists online en masse, there is a problem.	2
Most reasonable people think groups like the KKK, the Golden Dawn, Nazis, Militant anarchist terrorists, ISIS, Al-Qaeda and any other neo-fascist group are dangerous.	2
on principle who gets to define what being a reasonable person is	2
Stalin thought non-stalinists were dangerous	2
probably a lot of Russians did too who most would consider reasonable	2
Remember reasonable people actually voted Hitler into office	2
The moderate majority of the world gets to decide the demarcations for the narrow political band around the center.	2
Pre-WW2 germany or Stalinist Russia weren't all that stable.	2
Tyrants and tyranny are as old as politics themselves.	2
Ever heard of the Reign of Terror?	2
who gets to decide what being a moderate was	2
why is it tied to what the majority wants	2
Todays moderates are tomorrows conservatives	2
throughout history the majority has been okay with a lot of terrible shit	2
It seems a need for censorship implies a certain degree of exposure to these ideas.	2
stable democracies have elected terrible people too who have done terrible things	2
100 years of reasonable people who likely were considered moderates lead a persecution of Indians from the Trial of Tears to Wounded Knee.	2
Genocide is something most of the world has moved past	2
only a few extremist individuals try to advocate it	2
However this isn't about being just a bit conservative.	2
It's about people that advocate death and destruction - terrorism, genocide, ethnic cleansing and murder.	2
People thought the exact same thing before WWI.	2
They thought they were too civilized for what would happen in the next 50 years.	2
Rwanda wasn't that long ago either	2
One person's terrorist is another person's freedom fighter.	2
One's person's genocide is another person's defense of their culture.	2
One person's murderer is a other's soldier.	2
J. S. Mill would have been considered an extreme feminist back when he wrote	2
today he's very much in the center of mainline liberal thought	2

The German majority needs to grow a spine and say enough is enough.	1
this is obviously extreme	1
you see how such an extreme zero tolerance policy can be dangerous in its inflexibility and its arbitrariness	1
The thing is though, what is considered a political fringe isn't really all that subjective.	1
I don't disagree	1
Well we have the benefit of history.	1
In a stable democracy this isn't too hard to figure out.	1
So did they.	1
Is a democracy really that stable if it needs to censor radical ideas to stop nastiness from happening?	1
hasn't most of the world moved past the age of tyrannical rulers	1
I do agree that today's moderates are potentially tomorrow's conservatives	1
Conservatives don't do this, it's extremists.	1
There will always be evil people that bring misery to the world.	1
I challenge the assertion we have moved past it considering what's happening in the middle east	1
even beyond tyranny the west seems complicit in a global order that directly leads to many deaths of the worlds poor each day that they could have prevented	1
I don't think all these comparisons are true	1
they certainly aren't hard to make	1
And they certainly have been made throughout history.	1
Exactly	1
my point there wasn't that conservatives are terrible, but that what is considered moderate and okay changes	1
It isn't some objective fact about people.	1
The point is what people consider moderate and reasonable isn't set in stone	1
to adopt a zero tolerance policy cuts too deeply and may cut in the wrong direction	1
Your first paragraph is intriguing	1
I definitely agree with it	1
The freedom fighter/terrorist comparison is also an interesting perspective.	1
Although I do think more needs to be done to combat extremism, I see where you're coming from on this.	1

As other's said, who gets to decide what these bad ideologies are.	0
Here's a substitution using your syntax, but modified details.	0
> Zero tolerance, whatever it takes.	0
Schools should educate children on the dangers of jewish zionism and their poison should be kept out of the minds of children.	0
Young impressionable minds are the easiest targets for zionist indoctrination.	0
In a highly connected online era, it has become far too easy to recruit people into the zionist movement.	0
When facebook and twitter is used to recruit zionist supporters and other jewish terrorists online en masse, there is a problem.	0
The German majority needs to grow a spine and say enough is enough.	0
Now, this is obviously extreme, but you see how such an extreme zero tolerance policy can be dangerous in its inflexibility and its arbitrariness.	0
The thing is though, what is considered a political fringe isn't really all that subjective.	0
Most reasonable people think groups like the KKK, the Golden Dawn, Nazis, Militant anarchist terrorists, ISIS, Al-Qaeda and any other neo-fascist group are dangerous.	0
> Most reasonable people think groups like the KKK, the Golden Dawn, Nazis, Militant anarchist terrorists, ISIS, Al-Qaeda and any other neo-fascist group are dangerous.	0
I don't disagree, but on principle who gets to define what being a reasonable person is?	0
Stalin thought non-stalinists were dangerous, and probably a lot of Russians did too who most would consider reasonable.	0
Remember reasonable people actually voted Hitler into office.	0
Well we have the benefit of history.	0
The moderate majority of the world gets to decide the demarcations for the narrow political band around the center.	0
In a stable democracy this isn't too hard to figure out. Pre-WW2 germany or Stalinist Russia weren't all that stable.	0
> Well we have the benefit of history.	0
So did they.	0
Tyrants and tyranny are as old as politics themselves.	0
Ever heard of the Reign of Terror?	0
> The moderate majority of the world gets to decide the demarcations for the narrow political band around the center.	0
And who gets to decide what being a moderate was, and why is it tied to what the majority wants?	0
Todays moderates are tomorrows conservatives, and throughout history the majority has been okay with a lot of terrible shit.	0
> In a stable democracy this isn't too hard to figure out.	0
Is a democracy really that stable if it needs to censor radical ideas to stop nastiness from happening?	0
It seems a need for censorship implies a certain degree of exposure to these ideas.	0
Also, stable democracies have elected terrible people too who have done terrible things.	0
100 years of reasonable people who likely were considered moderates lead a persecution of Indians from the Trial of Tears to Wounded Knee.	0
But hasn't most of the world moved past the age of tyrannical rulers ?	0
Genocide is something most of the world has moved past, and only a few extremist individuals try to advocate it.	0
I do agree that today's moderates are potentially tomorrow's conservatives.	0
However this isn't about being just a bit conservative.	0
It's about people that advocate death and destruction - terrorism, genocide, ethnic cleansing and murder.	0
Conservatives don't do this, it's extremists.	0
> Is a democracy really that stable if it needs to censor radical ideas to stop nastiness from happening?	0
There will always be evil people that bring misery to the world.	0
Why is it wrong to try and stop them ?	0
> But hasn't most of the world moved past the age of tyrannical rulers ? Genocide is something most of the world has moved past, and only a few extremist individuals try to advocate it.	0
People thought the exact same thing before WWI.	0
They thought they were too civilized for what would happen in the next 50 years.	0
And I challenge the assertion we have moved past it considering what's happening in the middle east.	0
Hell, Rwanda wasn't that long ago either.	0
And even beyond tyranny the west seems complicit in a global order that directly leads to many deaths of the worlds poor each day that they could have prevented.	0
> I do agree that today's moderates are potentially tomorrow's conservatives. However this isn't about being just a bit conservative. It's about people that advocate death and destruction - terrorism, genocide, ethnic cleansing and murder.	0
One person's terrorist is another person's freedom fighter.	0
One's person's genocide is another person's defense of their culture.	0
One person's murderer is a other's soldier.	0
Now, I don't think all these comparisons are true, but they certainly aren't hard to make.	0
And they certainly have been made throughout history.	0
> Conservatives don't do this, it's extremists.	0
Exactly, my point there wasn't that conservatives are terrible, but that what is considered moderate and okay changes.	0
It isn't some objective fact about people.	0
J. S. Mill would have been considered an extreme feminist back when he wrote, but today he's very much in the center of mainline liberal thought.	0
The point is what people consider moderate and reasonable isn't set in stone, and to adopt a zero tolerance policy cuts too deeply and may cut in the wrong direction (either failing to get bad people or getting good people)	0
Your first paragraph is intriguing, and I definitely agree with it.	0
The freedom fighter/terrorist comparison is also an interesting perspective.	0
Although I do think more needs to be done to combat extremism, I see where you're coming from on this.	0

Like many American kids, I was often forced throughout my childhood to participate in "Monopoly" games with my family.	2
it just seems to be a giant crapshoot the whole way through	2
Once ~50% of the board has been claimed, even if the landholdings of all the players are about equal, it is immediately obvious which player will lose based on who falls in another's territory first and has to pay the incredulous tax.	2
After that, it is just a long fall into bankruptcy as eventually the player has to sell their property to others, decreasing the chance that they can earn revenue while simultaneously increasing the chance that the others can profit from them.	2
One after another, a player pays out the net-worth to the other players until there is a long, long drawn-out stand-off between the remaining few.	2
At this point, it comes to down to complete and utter chance.	2
Whomever gets the worst successive dice rolls loses.	2
When that happens, barring any statistically unlikely dice rolls, it is evident who will lose.	2
But the game keeps going and going, because it would be "unfair" to keep going despite the likely outcome.	2
perhaps a redesign of the board	2
more mechanics to tip the scales of chance perhaps with better "Chance" cards	2
even removal of the pieces entirely	2
Add penalties for each additional player over 3 so that the success and failures of each decision weigh more heavily	2
As of right now, after the first few passes around the board, it is easier to calculate the theoretical outcome with the help of a computer then to finish the game to its completion.	2
because it's very, very common for people to unwitting ignore or add rules and cause the game to run longer	2
By far the most egregious violation of this nature is ignoring the Auction rule (where if the player who lands on an unbought space chooses not to buy it for face value, it is auctioned off to highest bidder), which makes it take much longer for people to build up property, dragging out the early stages of the game.	2
where if the player who lands on an unbought space chooses not to buy it for face value, it is auctioned off to highest bidder	2
Another common one I grew up with was the "Free Parking" rule addition, where landing on Free Parking confers some kind of monetary reward, which introduces more money into the game and makes it harder to go bankrupt, dragging out the game.	2
The game only becomes a drawn-out slugfest if players can't get monopolies	2
which only happens if players don't negotiate	2
This is the soul of the game	2
ignoring it is the reason many people develop a distaste for the game	2
If players A, B, C, and D are playing, and A is obviously ahead after a few go-arounds, should A just win?	2
Of course not!	2
B, C, and D should be conspiring like hell to take A down.	2
B can "not notice" when C and D land on his properties, making A the only one to pay rent.	2
C and D can agree to help each other complete monopolies and make trades of that nature.	2
Once some players have monopolies, the other players have to either trade to make their own monopolies or get bled out quickly.	2
Once monopolies (and the corresponding houses and hotels) come into play, tiny rents become enormous and the game quickly comes to an end.	2
Forming monopolies is by far the quickest way to win	2
the easiest way to do so is through negotiating with other players, a point that many Monopoly players fail to notice	2
A properly played game of Monopoly may come down to luck in the end	2
but it's luck that is heavily influenced by the mid-game, which is decided by the players' diplomatic skill	2
Only recently (past 4 years) my family added money to the free parking	2
though I always attempted to get the auction rule in I was always voted down	2
If your fellow players absolutely refuse to negotiate, even when it would benefit them in the long run, then the game is not going to be fun.	2
It's like playing poker with players who never bet	2
it's not fun, it's just a long, awful slog	2
even though it can be unfun in some scenarios	2
The most beneficial trade I've found involves two players helping each other complete a monopoly, but giving "immunity" to that group.	2
i.e. Alice has two Yellow properties and one Green property, while Bob has two Green properties and one Yellow property	2
Alice agrees to trade her Green for Bob's Yellow, giving them both monopolies, on the condition that Alice won't have to pay if she lands on a Green property and Bob won't have to pay if he lands on a Yellow property	2
Players who don't like trades tend to be nervous about giving other players a better position	2
I find that they're more inclined to do so if they feel it won't come back to bite them	2
Seriously, immunity is great	2
Even without auctions, making sure people are aware that they can be "flexible" about collecting rent makes the game go much faster.	2
If you can't sell auctions, this should still help.	2
Perhaps my family (and quite a few other families) are just not equipped to play this game.	2
It is probably akin to Diplomacy	2
The family dynamic + the individual personalities of each player changes how the game goes	2
CMV: I think the board game "Monopoly" is poorly designed	1
there is very little skill involved in playing the game	1
Though it does this job well, I believe it is this intent that causes it to be thoroughly not fun.	1
While this system would work in a **quick** game between 2 to 3 people, monopoly is usually drawn out and played with 4+ players.	1
If Monopoly was redesigned to rely less on chance (perhaps a redesign of the board, more mechanics to tip the scales of chance perhaps with better "Chance" cards, or even removal of the pieces entirely) and to be quicker ( Add penalties for each additional player over 3 so that the success and failures of each decision weigh more heavily, for example) then the game will be much more fun and enjoyable to everyone.	1
I have to ask	1
Assuming that you're playing with auctions (and preferably without that Free Parking house rule), the key to the game is negotiation.	1
Monopoly is drawn out because people don't play by the rules, or the miss the main point of the game	1
Perhaps that is the reason why I have such a strong dislike of the game.	1
Though it is theoretically sound it may not hold up	1
It does admittedly depend a lot on the people you play it with.	1
That doesn't make Poker a bad game by design	1
it just means that it's not a game that everyone will enjoy	1
I'd recommend pointing out to people that the point of the game is to make trades.	1
Yeah, you're right.	1

First, are you actually playing monopoly according to the base rules? I have to ask because it's very, very common for people to unwitting ignore or add rules and cause the game to run longer.	0
By far the most egregious violation of this nature is ignoring the Auction rule (where if the player who lands on an unbought space chooses not to buy it for face value, it is auctioned off to highest bidder), which makes it take much longer for people to build up property, dragging out the early stages of the game.	0

In short, Monopoly is drawn out because people don't play by the rules, or the miss the main point of the game: monopolies.	0
Forming monopolies is by far the quickest way to win, and the easiest way to do so is through negotiating with other players, a point that many Monopoly players fail to notice.	0
A properly played game of Monopoly may come down to luck in the end, but it's luck that is heavily influenced by the mid-game, which is decided by the players' diplomatic skill.	0
That is a possibility of have not considered actually.	0
Only recently (past 4 years) my family added money to the free parking, and though I always attempted to get the auction rule in I was always voted down.	0
Perhaps that is the reason why I have such a strong dislike of the game.	0
Alas, I have not actually played it in a while and I'll play it with these rules before confirming the delta, for these rules may not be enough to convince me that the game is designed well.	0
Though it is theoretically sound it may not hold up	0
It does admittedly depend a lot on the people you play it with.	0
If your fellow players absolutely refuse to negotiate, even when it would benefit them in the long run, then the game is not going to be fun.	0

For the sake of this thread, we'll exclude children with medically diagnosed learning disabilities	2
With a healthy child, income, neighborhood, peers and teachers should be filtered through a responsible parent(s).	2
maybe a monetary incentive derived from public tax coffers paid to parents of children who maintain a passing grade, to be withheld if child dips below	2
I had parents who were extremely persistent about making sure i stayed on track.	2
I was only recently diagnosed with adhd a reading disability	2
im 20 years old	2
I graduated on time but i struggled so much	2
I failed a bunch of stuff and was constantly embarrassed to show my grades to other people.	2
I lost hope often because things felt hopeless	2
which lead teachers, doctors, family and other students to think i just didnt care	2
Thats because we teach everyone to think the same way.	2
Im really good at doing certain things.	2
For example, i can read , write, and even speak backwards pretty well.	2
My brain is wired differently.	2
I cant do the things the average person can	2
i can do a lot of things that they cant	2
im capable of the same things just in a different way	2
my experience at school did its best to convince me that i was stupid	2
thats because its not tapping into their mind right	2
Parents should be educated on how to identify *how* their child's mind works.	2
This is what I meant when I said "100%" on the parents.	2
CMV: If a child struggles to achieve in grade school it is virtually always the parents' fault.	1
IMO the knowledge and resource base for teaching said children is probably proportionate to the percentage they make up of the overall population	1
A child who struggles in earnest or intentionally slacks off is a direct reflection of parenting.	1
I am curious regarding potential for more public accountability held to parents who fail to direct their child.	1
I think parents are virtually 100% responsible for producing scholastically successful children	1
An issue is there are a ton of people with "disabilities" more so than you'd think.	1
Thats the issue.	1
It doesnt make me stupid	1
THAT is the issue	1
Everyone has a mind that works in its own way	1
The problem isnt always bad parenting, though that can play a role,	1
the problem is a black and white educational system	1
Treating everyone the same way, other than special classes for "dumb" kids is the problem.	1
Learning seems hard or dumb to some kids	1
If a child can discuss something he or she cares about then the parents are just a plus.	1
Yes.	1
I think that builds my initial point.	1
You're parents would've known how to turn the way your mind worked into a successful academic career, in a perfect world.	1

My brain is wired differently.	0
I cant do the things the average person can, but i can do a lot of things that they cant.	0
It doesnt make me stupid, because im capable of the same things just in a different way, but my experience at school did its best to convince me that i was stupid.	0
THAT is the issue.	0
Everyone has a mind that works in its own way.	0
The problem isnt always bad parenting, though that can play a role, the problem is a black and white educational system.	0
Treating everyone the same way, other than special classes for "dumb" kids is the problem.	0
Learning seems hard or dumb to some kids and thats because its not tapping into their mind right.	0
If a child can discuss something he or she cares about then the parents are just a plus.	0

Yes.	0
I think that builds my initial point.	0
Parents should be educated on how to identify *how* their child's mind works.	0
This is what I meant when I said "100%" on the parents.	0
You're parents would've known how to turn the way your mind worked into a successful academic career, in a perfect world.	0
For the sake of this thread, we'll exclude children with medically diagnosed learning disabilities	2
With a healthy child, income, neighborhood, peers and teachers should be filtered through a responsible parent(s).	2
maybe a monetary incentive derived from public tax coffers paid to parents of children who maintain a passing grade, to be withheld if child dips below	2
since it would only be a suspension of "assistance" anyway	2
And poverty is a formidable obstacle but many, many people come from poverty to be wildly successful.	2
e.g. they don't have time because they are having to work 2 jobs just to support the children	2
they're statistically dumber than richer people	2
Ignorance might be the cause, of course, rather than just lack of intrinsic intelligence	2
There's really no reason to believe that every person has exactly the same potential to succeed well in school	2
A simpler explanation is that native intelligence is probably normally distributed, like almost every other trait people possess	2
Some people can do some thing's better than others	2
CMV: If a child struggles to achieve in grade school it is virtually always the parents' fault.	1
IMO the knowledge and resource base for teaching said children is probably proportionate to the percentage they make up of the overall population	1
A child who struggles in earnest or intentionally slacks off is a direct reflection of parenting.	1
I am curious regarding potential for more public accountability held to parents who fail to direct their child.	1
I think parents are virtually 100% responsible for producing scholastically successful children	1
One of the largest predictors for success appears to be not being poor.	1
It seems like fining poor people has some potential negative effects... on the children.	1
It wouldn't be a fine	1
That cannot be a blanket excuse for poor academic performance.	1
I believe the fulcrum of a child's development has always been, and will always be the parent(a living, mentally capable set of or just one parent).	1
Yeah	1
my point is that giving money to people that have successful children is going, ultimately, to lead to giving money to people that already have money, and withholding it from ones that don't	1
Unless you make the reward high enough to overcome the *reasons* that poor parents are less involved (e.g. they don't have time because they are having to work 2 jobs just to support the children), it's not going to solve the problem.	1
that's going to be very expensive	1
there's a more fundamental *reason* that poor parents are poorer at helping their children	1
It would seem that a better approach would be to pay parents to attend training on how to be better parents, rather than rewarding the ones that have just happened to figure it out on their own	1
I think you're just being naive about actual statistical variation in native intelligence	1
Native intelligence is the challenge.	1
a moneyless society would over time revert to fiat currency	1
Nice exercise	1

I won't delve into how this has infected my view, but I will say that it ties into why I think  a moneyless society would over time revert to fiat currency.	0
